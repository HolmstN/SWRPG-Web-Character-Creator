Aqualish had a reputation\n    for being nasty, crude and aggressive, and generally\n    pursued off-world careers as mercenaries, bounty\n    hunters, and pirates. One of the most infamous such\n    Aqualish was the smuggler Ponda Baba.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    An amphibious species native to the planet Ando, the\n    Aqualish people are made up of three distinct races\n    which included the Aquala, the Ualaq and the Quara.\n    Although they all had their differences, their\n    baseline genetic structure was the same and their\n    appearances did not vary so drastically as to\n    characterize them as different species. All Aqualish\n    have two facial tusks which curved down over their\n    mouths; a trait which adds to their appearance as\n    arachnids. Indeed, the Aqualish have some arachnid\n    genetic material in their distant past, as\n    demonstrative in their relationship with the Harch\n    species. These facial tusks are highly sensitive\n    to heat and cold, and were used for cracking open\n    the hard shells of shellfish or burrowing through\n    the swampy loam of their homeworld.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    The Aquala hate their Quara relatives, as they\n    blame them for the image the Aqualish had on the\n    galaxy as thugs. Because of this the latter\n    subspecies are considered pariahs on Ando, which\n    has a lower population of Aqualish than the galaxy\n    itself. All three Aqualish subspecies speak\n    mutually intelligible dialects of the same language.\n    Quarrelsome and thug-like, the Aqualish culture\n    revolves around aggression and toughness, with\n    diplomacy being one of their weakest attributes.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Ando, the homeworld of the Aqualish, is an oceanic\n    planet located in the Ando system of the Mid Rim.  The\n    sea covers 95% of the world.  The majority of the\n    world's islands are sustained by a decaying swamp\n    ecosystem and covered in steamy mist.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Aqualish is the official language of the planet \n    Ando, spoken by the Aqualish species. The three \n    subspecies of Aqualish—Aquala, Quara and Ualaq—each \n    have a different dialect. However, these regionalisms \n    are so similar that they are easily understood by \n    speakers of the separate dialects.\n    </p> <p>Aqualish vocal cords cause harsh guttural \n    sounds, which are common in the Aqualish language, \n    but uncommon in Basic. If an Aqualish speaks Galactic \n    Basic Standard, it sounds coarse and brutish. Most \n    Aqualish do not learn Basic unless they needed to, \n    which usually means they have been forced to leave \n    their homeworld.\n  </p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Arcona</h4> <p>\nThe Arcona are an alien race native to the planet Cona. Other important colonies of Arcona are Celenuir and Teke Ro - two planets located in the Mayagil sector.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nThe Arcona are scaleless reptiles, ranging between 1.7 to 2 meters tall. They are bipedal and humanoid in nature, with three toes on each foot and two fingers and one thumb on each hand, all with talons approximately 3 to 4 inches in length. They have triangular heads, large glittering eyes, and the nose and mouth are merely three barely visible slits in the face. The planet Cona, their homeworld, is a hot, ammonia-filled, dense world orbiting the blue giant Teke Ro.\n</p> <p>Because everything they eat contains ammonia, the Arcona have developed a tolerance for it, and also require ammonia to create enzymes necessary for their very survival. The Arcona use ammonia particularly to supplement their circulatory systems and eliminate waste, disperse body heat and carry nutrients to their thick hides. In spite of this, the Arcona still have a dependency on water. They use their clawed hands and feet to dig up the plants and harvest water.\n</p> <p>Another interesting feature about the Arcona is the bulbous growth between their eyes, which looks similar to a nose. In fact, this is not an olfactory organ at all, but an acutely accurate heat sensing organ, useful in sensing and locating another creature, and as such, an excellent supplement to their weak eyes. The eyes of the Arcona are multi-faceted, much like an insect or spider. Each facet is designed to perceive a different colour or shade, and will alert the Arcona to slightest of movements. But, they have no ability to see three dimensions. Because of this weakness, the Arcona only see the world around them as an imperceptible blur of motion and colour.\n</p> <p>An Arcona's lifespan is roughly the same as a Human's. The Arcona live in a family based community, where the males take care of the young, as the females are generally reckless and thrill-seeking. Despite not being a particularly technological species, by the time the Galactic Empire rose to power, Arcona could be seen in every corner of the galaxy. They are also notorious for their easy addiction to common salt.\n</p> <p>The Arcona adapted to the harmful environment of their homeplanet by eating the ammonia-converting roots of the complex flora of Cona as a source of water (the only water planet-wide). The Arcona depend on the ammonia to live and, as a result, Arcona living offworld have to take ammonia supplements or they will risk death.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nThe Arcona place greater emphasis on the rights of the group than the rights of the individual. However, there are a few acceptable variations. The best example of this is an Arconan's devotion to its offspring, placing far greater importance in it's own than the offspring of others in its own clan. The Arcona reside in loose communities composed of several family nests.\n</p> <p>Arcona normally think of themselves as a whole. Virtually, they have no individuality. They often refer to themselves as \"we\" even when only one is present. Because Arcona are born in nests underground they obtain a close sense of family living in close quarters with brothers and sisters.\n</p> <p>This society arose because of the need to protect the young from danger, for Cona is a dangerous place for the immature or uninitiated. Arcona parents must spend much of their time protecting their young from the jungles of Cona, or the hatchlings can trigger a spine trap, drink poison, or be eaten by carnivorous plants. Because of the long-term commitment involved in raising a nest of hatchlings, Arcona do not enter into the bond lightly. Males are generally the more finicky of the two genders, and when bonded, Arcona will bond for life.\n</p> <p>The hierarchy of the group is such - A community is usually built within 20 kilometers from a clearing. Every 20 days, all adult Arcona meet there and discuss community business. These meetings are led by the Nest Leader, a male who is chosen by popular vote and can be replaced at any time. Although they possessed a pre-industrial technology level before their world was discovered, the Arcona have since been completely acclimated into the general galactic populace successfully.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nCona is the largest planet within the Teke Ro system. Its relatively hot temperatures and somewhat odd atmosphere make it an uncomfortable place for any except for the indigenous species. Cona`s atmosphere is composed mostly of a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen. Ammonia vapour results from the high concentration of the two elements, a usually deadly characteristic for non-Arcona. The lack of oxygen in the air is supplemented by an extraordinary amount of it within the ground.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nArconese is the official language of Cona and the native language of the local species, the Arcona. However, those Arcona born and raised in colonies outside of Cona do not usually learn Arconese, but the local language instead.</p>",

      "Description" : "\n    <h4>Arkanian</h4> <p>\n    The Arkanians are a near-Human species which reside primarily on the frozen planet\n    of Arkania in the Perave system of the Colonies region of the galaxy.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    Arkanians considere themselves the pinnacle of evolution, and as such many are\n    distinctly arrogant. Arkanian scientists have been experts in genetic manipulation\n    for millennia, and by the time of the Mandalorian Wars the species had been split\n    into many sub-species, making it hard to determine exactly what a baseline Arkanian\n    is. Most could pass for Human, though the most pure of blood had pure white eyes\n    and four clawed digits on each hand.\n    </p> <p>Arkanians are capable of seeing into the infrared spectrum, and their eyes are\n    sensitive to sources of extreme heat. This is helpful on their dark and frigid\n    homeworld, but when traveling offworld, many are forced to wear blinders on\n    planets with hotter, younger suns. It is also not unusual for an Arkanian to\n    enhance themselves with internal and/or external cybernetics. It is also standard\n    practice for Arkanians to undergo genetic manipulation of their own bodies, enhancing\n    themselves so as to be better than lesser species.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    The most defining trait of the Arkanian species is their arrogance which stemmed\n    from their belief that they were the pinnacle of evolution. This leads to them often\n    appearing arrogant and aloof to others as they see themselves as being superior to all\n    other species. Even those with a more moderate viewpoint tended to see themselves as\n    being amongst the most intelligent beings in the galaxy. As such, they are highly\n    confident of their abilities.\n    </p> <p>Visitors to their homeworld often face unpleasant and arrogant Arkanians—despite\n    this, Arkanians are deeply offended by impoliteness and when this occurrs, the offending\n    individual needs to make amends quickly or risk being ostracized. When offended, an\n    Arkanian typically speaks badly of the other party once they are gone and when no apology\n    is given—the Arkanians are known to lock up the person or detain their starship from\n    leaving the planet with overt threats. Even at this point, however, it is possible to\n    redeem themselves in the eyes of an Arkanian though failure means that they became even\n    more offended and storm away. But, if successful, the individual needs to also offer a\n    gift to the offended Arkanian as a sign of their sincerity.\n    </p> <p>Knowledge and research are highly prized within Arkanian society which means that\n    many of the species are highly skilled scientists as well as academics. Their near\n    boundless arrogance and great wealth as well as dedication is unmatched by others within\n    their scientific community creating research projects that easily match those of the\n    Galactic Empire. Imperial researchers often struggle to\n    match the dedication of the Arkanians as their projects often took generations to\n    unfold. In addition, they are not above using their intelligence and research to\n    gain profit with their corporations massing great wealth due to medical treatments\n    entering the market at opportune moments. Arkanian scientists are well known explorers\n    and they are also famous for their skills in genetic manipulation which results from\n    their fascination in the genetic make-up of other races. This has led to frequent\n    experimentation on alien species, much to the subjects' detriment as a result of\n    Arkanian involvement.\n    </p> <p>The Arkanians themselves are not above genetic experimentation with this avenue of\n    research leading to the creation of the Arkanian Offshoots that are engineered to perform\n    specific tasks. Occasionally, a number of racist pure blood Arkanians were known to conduct\n    purges of the Offshoot population. Reactions to the Offshoots varied as some Arkanians\n    viewed them as little more than tools or even as slaves but many believed that they are\n    an example of the cruel consequences of Arkanian corporate greed.\n    </p> <p>Results of their scientific work has led to great advances in medical techniques\n    throughout the galaxy whilst others are considered some of the greatest atrocities\n    known. They are known to have made significant contributions in the fields of cybernetic\n    medical technology and micro-circuitry. Their actions have, however, led to many races\n    holding a negative view of their kind which resulted from the actions of their scientists.\n    However, many Arkanians are either embarrassed or even horrified at the acts their kind\n    has gone to in the name of science. The more conscientious of their kind tended to be\n    favored as allies of the Jedi Order and the Republic through their darkest hours.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Arkania is the adopted homeworld of the Arkanian species. It is covered with tundra\n    and rich in diamonds and other precious minerals, which the Arkanians mine to further\n    their offworld connections and master their technology. Arkanian cities are designed to\n    keep the cold out, and are mostly completely enclosed. Off-world visitors rarely have\n    to deal with the frigid conditions of the planet.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    The language of the Arkanian people was developed on their homeworld, Arkania before \n    they made contact with the civilized galaxy and the Galactic Republic. When contact \n    with the greater galaxy was established, young Arkanians were taught Arkanian and Basic, \n    so the majority of the population is bilingual. Among the Arkanian Offshoots, a \n    slightly different dialect gradually emerged, emphasizing words of submission and \n    forgetting those of victory or the desire to challenge.\n  </p>",

They also have the pointed ears of the Sephi of Thustra,\n    a species of humanoids with whom they also share genetic material.  \n    </p> <p>With stark white skin, the offshoots are easily distinguished from the pure-bloods \n    and are often times shunned, even if covertly.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    The Arkanians themselves are not above genetic experimentation with this avenue of\n    research leading to the creation of the Arkanian Offshoots that are engineered to perform\n    specific tasks. Occasionally, a number of racist pure blood Arkanians were known to conduct\n    purges of the Offshoot population. Reactions to the Offshoots varied as some Arkanians\n    viewed them as little more than tools or even as slaves but many believed that they are\n    an example of the cruel consequences of Arkanian corporate greed.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Arkania is the adopted homeworld of the Arkanian species. It is covered with tundra\n    and rich in diamonds and other precious minerals, which the Arkanians mine to further\n    their offworld connections and master their technology. Arkanian cities are designed to\n    keep the cold out, and are mostly completely enclosed. Off-world visitors rarely have\n    to deal with the frigid conditions of the planet.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    The language of the Arkanian people was developed on their homeworld, Arkania before\n    they made contact with the civilized galaxy and the Galactic Republic. When contact\n    with the greater galaxy was established, young Arkanians were taught Arkanian and Basic,\n    so the majority of the population is bilingual. Among the Arkanian Offshoots, a\n    slightly different dialect gradually emerged, emphasizing words of submission and\n    forgetting those of victory or the desire to challenge.\n  </p>",

A highly aggressive and territorial species, Barabel who traveled off\n    their homeworld often find work as fringers or hired guns.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    Barabel are a bipedal race of reptilians who are covered in very tough dark colored\n    scales. Evolved from nocturnal lizards, the Barabel adapted a thick layer of fat\n    which allowed them to remain active and not sluggish when temperatures dropped. A\n    blaster set on stun would not damage them at all or slow them down, as it would\n    merely bounce off their scales. Barabel are able to shed their tails if necessary,\n    an ability that proved the undoing of many a startled foe. They also possess\n    heavy retractable claws along with needle sharp teeth which could grow to be\n    5 centimeters in length. A carnivorous species, Barabel possess two stomachs\n    in order to process the mass amount of food they required to survive.\n    </p> <p>For breeding, Barabel devised a system in which the nest eggs of two females\n    were fertilized by two males. Subsequently, the four individuals protected the\n    nest. As fathers would end up not knowing which of the offspring were their own,\n    Barabel younglings took the surname of their mothers.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    Living in low tech communities ranging from a few dozen individuals to no more\n    than ten thousand, the Barabel community is built around a warren where\n    from which the group thrives and hunts. The Barabel species is noted for its hunting\n    and tracking prowess. This is because many of their actions are fueled by their\n    hunting instincts, leading to the general feeling that Barabel are always angry,\n    or in the very least ornery. They are well known for their aggression but are\n    also extremely loyal to their mates and parents. They also have a great deal of\n    respect for the Jedi, because of their first experiences with a Jedi master who\n    settled a dangerous clan dispute. Apologies, whether for a misdeed or in sympathy,\n    are an unknown concept to Barabel. It is considered mildly insulting to a Barabel\n    to be apologized to and apologizing tended to actually make a situation worse. This\n    sometimes is disconcerting for members of other species, especially Humans, who\n    are more ruled by emotions such as guilt or sympathy.\n    </p> <p>Barabel are a communal race, with\n    separate tribes on their homeworld numbering up to 10,000 individuals under the\n    guidance of a pack leader. Unlike Humans, Barabel are much closer to the subconscious\n    parts of their brains than other species. Lone Barabel tend to refer to themselves\n    as \"this one\" instead of typical first person pronouns such as me or I. Some common\n    Barabel names are Ragath, Vangar, Tesar, Saba, Zal and Zozoped.\n    </p> <p>The Barabel have a rich mythology which resolves around a historic landing of a\n    group of Jedi Knights early in their history. Worshiping the Jedi as gods, the\n    Barabel mythology revers these 'warriors from beyond the clouds.' Among Barabel\n    beliefs are a group of demons called the Blight of Barabel. Their names are often\n    used as curses.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    A murky world shrouded in darkness, Barab I's star is a dim red dwarf that made \n    the planet very dark. The planet orbits the star within less than 125 million \n    kilometers, and the planet has a day period of sixty standard hours. During the \n    day, the planet is irradiated with gamma, ultraviolet and infrared rays, forcing \n    all life on the planet to delve underground or cocoon itself else it be destroyed. \n    Therefore, all species are nocturnal and adapted to hunt or forage in the evening \n    without the risk of radiation poisoning. Because the world's oceans and standing \n    water evaporated during the extremely hot day period, sudden torrential downpours \n    soak the planet at night, forcing the natives to hunt quickly or risk being \n    washed away.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Barabel is the native tongue of the Barabel species, spoken on their native world Barab I.\n    Barabel language includes mainly barks and hisses which are harsh-sounding. Barabels can\n    speak Basic but they are not prone to learn it, unless they needed it. Most Barabels\n    leaving Barab I make an extra effort to learn Basic or another, more widely used language.\n  </p>",

The addition of the extra appendages require a hearty metabolism, and these bulky beings are able to store food and water for many days, and if the need arises, they could survive for long periods without either. Scruffy sensory whiskers line the area below their noses, just above the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nBecause of Ojom's harsh environment, large cities were never developed on the world; instead small communes of about a thousand families claime territories around the world and are each led by an elected leader.

Their thumb and\n    small finger are both fully opposable. The Bith's internal systems are\n    different from most humanoids, as the Bith have only one lung, and exhale\n    through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having\n    highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.\n    </p> <p>The other Bith senses are also acute. Bith can sense the tonal\n    qualities of sound as well as other races sense colors. Their eyes,\n    as big as a Menahuun's, are able to focus to 0.07 on the Gandok Scale\n    and they can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely\n    nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors\n    is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as\n    causing their heads to explode. Similarly, Bith have high manual dexterity\n    which helped them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with\n    gross motor skills is only average.\n    </p> <p>Bith have even evolved past the need for sleep. Instead, they will slip into\n    a light meditative trance, which allows them to get as much rest in four\n    hours as other species can get in eight. During this trance, Bith are\n    still almost fully aware of their surroundings. A Bith's reproductive organs\n    atrophied over time, as did the portions of their brain governing such impulses.\n    As such, Bith are unable to reproduce naturally, instead relying on artificial\n    conception and gestation. Mates bring genetic material to a Computer Mating\n    Service for analysis against prospective mates. Bith children are created from\n    genetic material from two parents, which is combined, fertilized, and incubated\n    for a year.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    A species of pacifists following the devastation of their homeworld during the\n    Nozho-Weogar War many Bith work as engineers, data analysts, or in other\n    intellectual professions. Others use their intelligence, natural technical skills,\n    and dexterity to work in the criminal underworld. Many Bith work as cantina\n    staff, since bartenders in Bith society held a position equivalent in many ways to\n    priests in other cultures.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Clak'dor VII is a small planet orbiting the large white star Colu in the Colu\n    system of the Outer Rim Territories on the Rimma Trade Route. It was a long-time\n    member of the Galactic Republic and was also the homeworld of the Bith species.\n    </p> <p>The Bith evolved over the millennia, and making use of their powerful senses\n    of sight and hearing became a race of artists, scientists and musicians. They\n    built great cities in the mountains and the jungles of Clak'dor VII. However\n    around 320 BBY, a conflict erupted on the planet between the capital city of\n    Weogar and its domed counterpart Nozho over a stardrive patent. When subterfuge\n    was detected by Weogar, war soon broke out and a chemical attack was launched\n    by Nozho on the capital. The retaliatory biological strike on Nozho wiped the\n    city out and destroyed Clak'dor VII's ecosystem, destroying the planet's ability\n    to produce either the basic needs for its citizens or goods for export. The surviving Bith on the\n    planet were forced to relocate into domed cities, now proclaiming themselves\n    pacifists and seldom venturing into the irradiated swamps, where the wildlife\n    mutated into such lifeforms as the Ghhhk.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Bith or Bithian is the native language of the Bith from Clak'dor VII.

    "CEREAN" : {
      "Description" : "\n    <h4>Cerean</h4> <p>\n    Cereans are a sophisticated and cultured humanoid mammalian species hailing from\n    the planet Cerea in the Mid Rim. They have tall tapering heads, which house large\n    binary brains, enabling them to focus on many things at the same time. Aside from\n    this unique feature, Cereans are physically similar to Humans, although they each\n    possesse two hearts, which supply extra blood circulation to support their brains.\n    </p> <p>Cerean males age more quickly than the females, who have similar lifespans to\n    Humans. Thus, there are fewer males than females. Polygamous marriage are a\n    necessity in order for the species to survive. Each male usually has one primary\n    \"bond-wife\", and between four and ten \"honor-wives\".\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    The Cereans' enlarged skulls, extending up to twenty centimeters above their\n    foreheads, house complex binary brains, provided with sufficient blood by an\n    extra heart in their heads. The binary structure of Cerean thinking helps\n    them to ponder two sides of an issue at once. It also enables them to process\n    information and solve problems rapidly and provides a highly advanced capacity\n    for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tend\n    to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a\n    lifestyle which works in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans\n    have equally quick reflexes, they are commonly not as well coordinated as Humans.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    Cereans developed a low–tech society on their homeworld and prefer to live\n    in isolation from the wider galaxy. During the years leading up to the Invasion\n    of Naboo, a generational dispute erupted on Cerea when the younger generation\n    took up a rebellious stance against their low–tech society. Many Cerean youths\n    wished to own such technology as was commonplace in the Galactic Republic, like\n    starships and speeder bikes.\n    </p> <p>Many Cereans use specially-forged Kasha crystals as a meditational tool. By\n    focusing one's thoughts while in contact with such crystals, distractions are\n    eliminated, creating an exceptional meditation environment.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Cerea is a planet located in the Mid Rim region of the galaxy. The homeworld\n    of the Cerean species, Cerea is notable for its inhabitants' harmonious relationship\n    with nature. Technology and pollution are frowned upon by the conservative\n    government, a major point in the planet's decision not to join the Galactic Republic.\n    The Cerean population mainly live in giant buildings that take up a minimum of\n    space, allowing the remainder of the planet's area to be employed as farmland.\n    Foreign immigrants and visitors are, with a few exceptions, only allowed in Cerea's\n    Outsider Citadels, enormous buildings erected to let non-Cereans practice their\n    technological ways. This ensures that the foreigners' technology does not contaminate\n    Cerea's nature, but also leads to a concentration of criminal elements within the Citadels.\n    </p> <p>Cerea is ruled by the Council of Elders, which in turn is led by a president.\n    The planet was for the most part ignored by the Republic until a few years prior to\n    the Clone Wars. Cerea's seclusion caused a unique culture to develop, one that focused\n    on other values than the mainstream galactic civilization. In 21 BBY, Cerea was the\n    site of a battle between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, which\n    had an adverse effect on the planet's relatively untouched nature.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Cerean is the official language of the planet Cerea.\n    It is mainly spoken by native Cereans. Despite their isolationist stance, \n    the Cereans also learn to speak Basic as children.\n    </p> <p>\"Chu'unthor\" is the Cerean word for \"academy,\" and the word \"Barsen'thor\" translates \n    to \"Warden of the Order.\"\n  </p>",

      "Description" : "\n    <h4>Chadra-Fan</h4> <p>\n    Chadra-Fan are short, rodent-like humanoids, usually no more than one meter\n    tall, with bat-like faces. They hail from the watery planet Chad.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    Chadra-Fan have seven different senses—sight, touch, taste, sound, smell, infrared\n    sight, and chemoreceptive smell—all of which were much more acute than Human senses.\n    They are usually no more than a meter tall, some depicted with plantigrade two-toed\n    feet, while others seemed to have four-toed digitigrade feet. The metabolism\n    of Chadra-Fan is amazingly fast, allowing them to work almost constantly. They only\n    sleep in two hour naps during the day. Because of their metabolism, the average Chadra-Fan\n    matures by age fifteen and rarely lives more than eighty years.\n    </p> <p>Chadra-Fan are covered from head to foot in fur. Their species evolved from small,\n    arboreal rodents. The two different sexes of Chadra-Fan are indistinguishable to other\n    species, though the Chadra-Fan can readily tell the difference using their powerful\n    sense of smell. If a male and a female Chadra-Fan are interested in one another they\n    released special pheromones that relay their feelings. Chadra-Fan also have involuntary\n    pheromones that conveyed information about their family line and create an aura of\n    attractiveness. Other voluntary pheromones often convey a Chadra-Fan's state of emotion - anger,\n    fear, or joy. Chadra-Fan even create more complex messages using their pheromones, though\n    the pheromones when mixed sometimes cause confusion. They are unique in the fact that\n    they have clear blood.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    The society of Chadra-Fan is divided into a clan structure in which every member is\n    responsible for parenting the clan's children and a fact of life is that every household\n    is open at any time. Leadership within the clan is a temporary role that is passed\n    from one individual to another as the situation calls for a particular expertise. Children\n    are the centerpiece of a Chadra-Fan community, and only left when wed.  However, the new Chadra-Fan\n    couple remain with the smaller clan so it is possible that a Chadra-Fan never\n    leaves his or her home.\n    </p> <p>Chadra-Fan, if left alone, suffer from strong depression that will kill them in a\n    matter of weeks. Thus, Chadra-Fan are not very picky when it comes to friends and prefer\n    complete strangers to loneliness. Many Chadra-Fan are taken offworld as slaves, but they\n    take this positively by thinking of it as a big adventure. They are also a jovial race, who\n    almost always get on well with others. Only the most evil acts against them will make them\n    think otherwise. Chadra-Fan are generally excellent team members and are extremely\n    forgiving or so ignorant that they forget any failings within a group. Chadra-Fan, thus,\n    can be found with various criminals because they are so unobservant or accommodating.\n    </p> <p>A deity called the Big Green Fish figures in Chadra-Fan religion.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    The planet Chad (also known as Chadra, or Chad III) is the homeworld of of the Chadra-Fan race.\n    It is in the Outer Rim Territories, more specifically in the Slice.\n    Chad is a watery planet, with extensive marshes and bayous. Chadra has nine moons, and has a\n    very elliptical orbit, giving rise to a complex tidal cycle. Due to its unusual orbit, it is\n    at different times either the third or fourth planet in the orbit of the blue-white star Chad.\n    It has no axial tilt, however, making the climate relatively stable.\n    </p> <p>The native Chadra-Fan, an arboreal race, dwell in simple dwellings in the tops of the bayous'\n    cyperill trees. They do not bother to make elaborate homes, as they know their dwellings could\n    be destroyed at any time by the hurricanes and tsunamis which their planet os prone to.\n    </p> <p>Chad is also home to a Human population. The Human colonists lived in oceanic ranches aboard large arks.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Chadra-Fan is the official language of the planet Chad, spoken mainly by the native Chadra-Fan species.\n    The Chadra-Fan language sounds quite different from Basic. This is noticed because Chadra-Fans who \n    learned to speak Basic sound very nasal and squeaky.\n  </p>",

    "CHEVIN" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Chevin</h4> <p>\nThe Chevin have thick, wrinkeled gray skin that provides a thick hide of protection, and the ability to regulate their body temperature. The Chevin stand around 2.5 meters on two thick legs that support their bulky frames. They have large heads, which support a trunk that stretches down to the ground. This trunk allows the Chevin to forage for food while watching for predators.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nThe Chevin evolved from smaller relatives of the giant mammals who were wiped out when an asteroid collided with Vinsoth millions of years before the time of the Galactic Republic. Chevin have long snouts which hang down nearly to their ankles. Combined with their intellect, this makes them skilled hunters of animals such as backshin, because they can smell out their prey or feed while keeping their eyes on the horizon. It was also their hunting prowess which allowed them to dominate their homeworld and conquer the Chevs. Chevin have thick legs, massive wide bodies, thin rope-like tails, and arms so long their three-fingered hands often brushed the ground. \n</p> <p>Despite their ungainly appearance, they can walk or run almost as fast as more nimble-looking humanoids. Chevin boast a double set of eyelids, one of which is transparent to prevent dust and wind from interfering with their vision. Their thick gray skin and efficient circulatory system keep them cool in warm climates and warm in cold climates, though they prefer semi-tropical conditions. The traditional Chevin costume consists of long, elaborately patterned robes (though they did not wear clothing until they were contacted by other species) and jewelry.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nDespite their appearance, the Chevin are a technologically advanced, carnivorous species belonging to the pachydermal family. The species originated on Vinsoth, a world of rolling plains, with arctic polar regions, and few deserts. Their culture has forged the species into a greedy one. Chevins are infamous for their lust for money, power, and status. They will accomplish their goals by any means necessary. The Galaxy has come to see Chevin as gamblers, smugglers, blackmailers, and gun runners. They are also notorious as slavers for manipulating the humanoid race of Vinsoth, the Chevin. Although the Chevin are capable of using weapons of destruction, they tend to let others do their dirty work, or just force their slaves to do it for them. Though technologically advanced, the Chevin did not research their technology. They acquired it from an unknown offworld source, and adapted it to their lifestyle and needs. As a migratory species, the Chevin once walked the plains of Vinsoth. Now with technology, most travel the world on large community platforms, similar to the Ithorians and their herdships. The destitute Chevin tend to employ ground vehicles with wheels, rather than the repulsorlifts that wealthier Chevin put to use. While the Chevin travel on the platforms, the slaves walk and are expected to keep up.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nThe planet Vinsoth is the capital of the Vinsoth system, Quelii sector. The large grassy continent and its small archipelago accounts for the majority of the planets population, containing vast business and bureaucratic districts, and has been likened by many to Coruscant in its sheer scale. The arctic regions on the South Pole are largely unexplored; though contain research facilities, whilst those on the north are mapped in great detail.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nChevin language is the native tongue of the Chevin species and the official language of planet Vinsoth.\n\nThere was another native species to Vinsoth besides of the Chevins: The Chevs, who had their own language. However, the Chevs were slaves to the Chevins, and the Chevins forced their Chev slaves to learn Chevin language (usually they also made them learn Basic). Thus, the Chevin language was spoken by both Chevs and Chevins, while Chev language was spoken only by the Chevs.\n\n</p> <p>As all the Chev speakers are familiar with the Chevin language, the Chevin language has had a great influence on the Chev language. Of course, Chevins traveling through the galaxy also learn to speak Basic.</p>",

    "CHISS" : {
      "Description" : "\n    <h4>Chiss</h4> <p>\n    The Chiss are a tall, blue-skinned Near-Human civilization from the planet\n    Csilla in the Unknown Regions, best known to most Humans as the people to which\n    Grand Admiral Thrawn belonged. Due to the remote position of their home\n    territory in the Chiss Ascendancy they remain largely an enigma to the\n    rest of the galaxy, and contact with outsiders was limited even in the days of\n    the Galactic Alliance.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    The Chiss are a near-Human species distinguished by their blue skin and glowing\n    red eyes, which grow darker depending on the oxygen content of their surroundings.\n    The more oxygen present, the more intense the color of their eyes and skin tone.\n    While their hair is typically jet black, it does on rare occasions go gray with\n    age (most Chiss believed that the development of gray hair is an indication of\n    the siring of exceptional children). Their physical form leads to some speculation\n    on whether they are an offshoot of humanity's ancient expansions into the galaxy\n    or whether their physical form coincidentally matched that of Humans. However,\n    genetic analysis indicates that they are an offshoot of humanity, and it is believed\n    that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans.\n    Furthermore, this analysis indicates that their unique skin tone is the result of\n    exposure to glacial minerals. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes\n    generally command attention once they are in a crowd of regular humanoids, and\n    these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable. Male\n    and female Chiss tend to be more powerfully built when compared to Humans but exhibit\n    the same variances as Humanoid sexes. A Chiss stands between either 1.6 to 2.1 meters\n    in height though an average height of an adult is 1.7 meters.\n    </p> <p>The University of Sanbra concluded that the fact that all Chiss often appear in\n    very good physical shape is an indication that the species possesses an active metabolism\n    which is responsible for their trim figure. Thus, this is believed to be responsible\n    for preventing obesity that was commonly found within more sedentary humanoids. While\n    the report concluded that they were indeed near-Humans, they had not determined a\n    specific point of evolutionary divergence. There was, in fact, a Human sleeper\n    ship colony established on Csilla around 27,500 BBY, though records of this were\n    virtually nonexistent and it remained unknown how a remote area of the galaxy could\n    have been trailblazed so far back. They did display, physiologically, very few\n    signs of evolutionary adaptations to their icy environment with even their skin\n    pigmentation not providing any apparent benefit. Beyond the obvious physical features,\n    physiologically, the Chiss are similar to Humans to the point that they possess a\n    comparable circulatory, neurological, digestive and reproductive systems. The Chiss\n    vocal mechanism is noted for being similar to Humans but there are apparent differences\n    which are evident in their capacity to speak their native language.\n    </p> <p>In addition, they experience a greatly accelerated growth rate compared to Humans,\n    which contributes to their reaching maturity faster than Humans. Thus a Chiss at the age\n    of 10-years holds the physical maturity of a 20-year old Human. This in turn results in\n    a culturally-imprinted emotional maturity that is many times above that of their Human\n    counterparts. They are capable of living up to 80 years old, at which point a Chiss\n    is considered venerable; children are between ages 1-10, and they experience a rapid\n    adolescence from 11-12 and are considered full adults by 13-14. Middle-age follows\n    between the ages of 51-62, and those aged 63-79 are considered old.\n\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    Galactic perceptions of Chiss behavior is, following the Battle of Endor, much based\n    on the personality of Grand Admiral Thrawn. However, following that period, it became apparent\n    that Thrawn himself was an exceptional member of his kind with all Chiss demonstrating\n    individually different traits. The impression held by the galaxy was that the Chiss were arrogant,\n    aloof and calculating beings. However, while this is true in some cases, the Chiss demonstrate\n    varying personality types similar to other species. General traits demonstrated by them, however,\n    are being well-educated, artistic and cautious when dealing with outsiders. Outsiders have the general\n    impression that the Chiss are very polite and highly civilized species. Their reputation means\n    that they are both respected and, in some cases, feared.\n    </p> <p>The harsh cold conditions of Csilla led to the Chiss developing a self-reliant streak which is\n    the core of their notoriously aloof personalities. This leads to outsiders characterizing their\n    race being as cold as the ice plains of their homeworld. As a people, they are intelligent\n    as well as highly valuing of their privacy. This extreme protection of their society is what\n    allowed them to remain hidden from the rest of the galaxy for so long. They are described as\n    being pensive as well as contemplative, deliberate and calculating. This means that they often\n    study situations from many different viewpoints. As such, they consider all alternatives to\n    a situation and even consider scenarios of what would have happened if they had made different\n    decisions. In combat situations, Chiss act both calmly and intelligently as well as form\n    well planned strategies. Chiss do not give themselves over to passion and instead view\n    problems as curiosities that need to be solved through rigorous application of brainpower.\n    As such, they do not allow hot emotions to interfere with their methodical analysis of a problem\n    through logic. In terms of personality, they often display a cold, arrogant and disciplined\n    behavior. Though they show a cold lack of emotion, their actions are not necessarily\n    impartial as most are motivated by the pursuit of power which is encouraged by their ruling families.\n    </p> <p>In general, they live a harsh but disciplined life style where self control along with propriety\n    are the most valued character traits that all Chiss aspire to. While passions themselves are\n    recognized, they are done so with disdain as such energy is believed to be better applied elsewhere.\n    The regimented style of their society means that crime is abhorred and seen as the weakness of\n    an individual. Blaming society is a notion completely alien to their mindset and justice is given\n    with little thought on compassion. However, the Chiss do not believe in capital punishment as\n    they recognize it as being an irrational, emotionally driven reaction instead of being a true\n    deterrent. Instead, the greatest punishment they give for their most heinous of crime is exile.\n    Due to the great importance of family loyalty existing in their culture, exile is considered a\n    grave punishment for any Chiss to face.\n    </p> <p>During their childhood, Chiss are taught to read through the great stacks of data of the great\n    library on Csilla. These contain basic information that every Chiss absorbs during their childhood\n    after years of intense schooling. Among their kind, there are no period of adolescence as their\n    children mature early and are given adult responsibilities very quickly. Scientists believe\n    that they essentially bypass the adolescent stage and reach maturity quickly. By the age of\n    ten, they are ready to join military service and wear cadet uniforms.\n    </p> <p>The species is highly\n    reserved in their emotions and often do not display feelings openly; either by smiling or by warm\n    gestures. As such, they rarely are vocal about any feelings of anger or frustration though\n    they do possess some curse words to employ should the situation warrant such an expression.\n    </p> <p>Though this is the impression projected, the Chiss are also a thoughtful people. While they\n    are deliberate and calculating, they are not above wondering about how certain events might have\n    turned differently had circumstances been altered. Much of their ability to solve problems stem from\n    their reliance on data, and when faced with unpredictable situations, typical Chiss behavior means that\n    they would rather flee the scene. This is not a universal characteristic as certain individuals with\n    the ability to learn under such circumstances, like Thrawn, are able to continue to fight.In fact,\n    whenever a Chiss suffers a setback or even a defeat, they often contemplate what might had been done\n    differently in order to ensure that a victory is achieved in the next engagement.\n    </p> <p>Chiss are noted\n    for possessing an unparalleled aptitude for tactical thinking. The ideals of the Chiss are idolized\n    in the form of the Red Flame which is a combination of courage, discipline and cunning.\n    Their society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by the ruling\n    families. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government.\n    The Csapla dictates colonial issues, natural resources and agriculture whilst the Nuruoda handle\n    the military as well as foreign affairs. Inrokini are responsible for industry, science, communication\n    and non-military technology with the Sabosen taking the duty of overseeing justice, public health as well\n    as education. These ruling families are composed of clans that are headed by government officials\n    known as Aristocras. Those chiss that belong to the same house defend one another at every opportunity\n    whilst those from competing houses search for facts that could be used to snipe or undermine the other\n    whilst attempting to secure any advantage for themselves. Though Thrawn was an exceptional member of his\n    species, his rational approach to problem solving was shared by the ruling families that govern the\n    Chiss Ascendancy. Members of the ruling class of Chiss are notable for being an aristocracy within\n    their society.\n    </p> <p>As a general rule, Chiss do not take part in any action that would bring shame on their house with\n    entire family lines exiled due to the actions of a single member. The ruling families themselves are\n    quite aware of any opportunity where they are able to exploit the weakness of a rival. As such, they are\n    quick to take offense at any insult that is perceived against their position. Those Chiss caught in the\n    middle of inter-house rivalries spend much of their time in intelligence gathering in order to get useful\n    information that could be used for blackmail even if it was only capable of being used many years in the\n    future. This trait makes the Chiss excellent counterintelligence agents with a trained member of their kind\n    able to see through disguises, evaluate body language, detect idiosyncrasies in speech pattern and even\n    distinguish authentic items from forgeries.\n    </p> <p>The long spacefaring history of the Chiss led to the creation of a superior combat force with their\n    starfighter pilots being infamous throughout the Unknown Regions. Such squadrons are ruled by discipline\n    and their pilots are known to spare disabled starships if they broadcast a surrender. They also do\n    not celebrate until their duty is completed as any celebrations made before such an event are considered\n    false. Despite this, they are highly committed in their duties and a Chiss warrior, if given an order,\n    will carry it out even if they disagreed with it, which highlights their belief in the chain of command.\n    It is also known that the Chiss as a culture has an aversion to suicide and expendability as they find\n    those actions to be wasteful. Though this is the case, there were occasions where Chiss gave their\n    lives rather then surrender. In such circumstances, this is either due to the importance of the strategy\n    for their people or because surrendering to a certain foe is considered a fate worse than death.\n    </p> <p>The Chiss have a keen interest in art and science and are skilled in mathematics. Their thought\n    processes are based around a logical mindset, being interested in philosophy and in learning about other\n    cultures. On the other hand, they are also xenophobic, and any knowledge gained from other cultures is\n    used as a means of gaining a advantage over a potential foe.\n    </p> <p>Their clinical detachment is similar to how a biologist studied an insect which is how the Chiss view\n    their foes and they often engage in extreme caution in such circumstances. When among non-Chiss, individual\n    members of the race are often aloof and pensive as they plot tactics which would ensure a victory if a\n    confrontation were to occur. Chiss never truly lose their xenophobic instincts, even when they are among\n    members of other species for long periods of time. Ultimately, Chiss are loyal to their own kind and\n    looked down upon aliens as being barbaric as well as immature. Despite this fact, most Chiss are\n    considered peaceful and abide by the strict code of conduct that governs their race. In addition,\n    though xenophobic, they are at times willing to accept members of other races into their ranks so long\n    as they prove to be exceptional as well as trustworthy individuals. Furthermore, the subject needs\n    to prove themselves capable of following Chiss disciplines in order to gain their loyalty and respect.\n    The Chiss are considered an honorable people who do not kill more than they think is necessary to\n    accomplish their goals. However, they are not above using biological weapons of mass destruction\n    against a foe should it be felt that their survival is being threatened.\n    </p> <p>When attacked, they respond with calm, intelligent and well-planned strategies while at the same time\n    remaining an honorable species. They never make conflicts personal and are very rarely aggressors as\n    they prefer to let conflicts come to them. Among the most famous traits of their kind is their refusal\n    to invade the territories of other species or even wage war over potential foes. As such, they do not\n    believe in the concept of a preemptive strike against their foes. Rather, they only respond to an enemy\n    assault after their foes have struck first. This is actually a by-product of their cool and cautious\n    philosophy. This is because, in their view, that by allowing their enemy to draw first blood they guarantee\n    that that they are acting in the right. Furthermore, it divorces their actions from any recklessness which\n    results from either impulsive anger or the incomplete intelligence of an enemy's intentions. Striking\n    first is thus an anathema to their discipline with even tactically sound preemptive strikes being the\n    subject of controversy. This moral imperative is so pervasive in their culture that they exiled Thrawn\n    from their society for breaching it. Once attacked, the Chiss do not rest until their attackers are\n    destroyed or completely subjugated.\n    </p> <p>The Chiss society has no concept of finances or money with everything being provided for by the state.\n    They also maintain tightly controlled borders that are self-sufficient in the isolated territory that\n    they rule. Their colonies supply them with both food and resources while developing technology comparable\n    to the rest of the galaxy. As such, they see no need for trade and their culturally derived contempt of\n    \"lesser races\" also prohibits them from forming better relations with their neighbors. In fact, the motive\n    for their exploration and expansion is difficult to determine as they lack the passion for conquering\n    the unknown which is a trait that Humans possessed. In addition, they do not claim new territory out of\n    greed or for a hunger for power. Their space program is mostly governed by the basic need to manage their\n    population and gathering resources without upsetting their homeworlds ecosystem. Their territory suffices\n    for their entire population needs. A report by the University of Sanbra indicates that the Chiss population\n    numbered nearly 5 trillion. Despite their growing border, they still foster a cultural contempt for other\n    species. Instead, they believe in isolation and the preservation of their heritage.\n    </p> <p>It is believed by many xenosociologists that the rigid and disciplined nature of Chiss society stemmed\n    from their cold environment on their homeworld. They are noted for displaying no signs of decadent or greedy\n    behavior and thus it is concluded that any signs of colonial expansion are mostly due to the Chiss desiring\n    to put order onto chaotic locations. This is in fact the leading theory by the University of Sanbra who\n    concluded that the motivation for Chiss expansion was their ideal of seeking to impose order on what they saw\n    as a chaotic and barbaric region. Being nearly impossible to enrage, they prefer to only act when all\n    factors have been taken into account with the issue itself analyzed. In addition, they believe firmly in\n    the chain of command as well as positions of authority. In fact, Chiss are taught to respect the position\n    itself rather then the person holding that title. As such, Chiss often respond when an individual calls\n    out the rank rather then their name.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Csilla, the homeworld of the Chiss, is a cold world of glaciers and snowy wastes located deep within\n    Chiss Space, and serves as the capital of the Chiss Ascendancy.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    The Chiss language is Cheunh and was first accepted during the developing years of their civilization \n    when they formed a planet-wide government which consisted of a single tongue that their society accepted. \n    It is known to be a dense and difficult synthetic language to master as complicated ideas are expressed \n    by uniting unrelated words into larger words. Thus, it has relatively few core words though the syntax \n    requires the speaker to piece together compound words which are complex and involved. One factor that \n    certainly adds to the complexity of the language is the fact that written Cheunh is not set down in a \n    phonetic alphabet. In writing, Cheunh do not possess an abstract alphabet like Aurebesh with ideograms \n    representing concepts and complex ideas being expressed by combining simpler ideograms. The Chiss hold \n    great pride in not only understanding but conversing in such a convoluted language. It is hard for \n    outsiders to understand though Car'das believed it to be logical, and the Chiss believe that the \n    grammar is logical and easy to learn. However, the Chiss believe it is quite impossible for non-Chiss \n    to learn to speak it properly. Though this complex nuance-filled language is difficult for non-Chiss \n    to master due to its intracacies, the Chiss themselves have little trouble mastering Basic though many \n    are unfamiliar with it. At least some phrases in the language are highly idiomatic – the pejorative \n    \"moactan teel\" literally meant \"fair-haired\", implying that something about the addressee was non-Chiss, \n    and thus barbarous.\n  </p>",

They have sunken cheeks with a narrow nose and a small mouth.\n    A thin line runs down their foreheads and creases the center of their noses. They possess\n    large eyes with slit-like pupils, and their irises can be yellow, gold, or blue.\n    Their skin is considered to be rough, and ranges in color from green to yellow. Overall,\n    their appearance is identical to that of their genetic forebears, the Zolanders.\n    </p> <p>Due to genetic manipulation, Clawdites possess the extremely rare ability to change\n    their appearance. When using this ability, they can change the color and texture of their\n    skin and eyes, mimicking the appearance of other similarly-shaped beings, such as Humans.\n    Shifting into a Weequay, a species with similar facial features, is considered to be an\n    easy task. Though they can not add physical mass to their bodies, they are able to\n    form hair, and can actually make it quite long. Clawdites are also able to mimic the\n    appearance of clothing or jewelry, provided that the item lays directly on their skin, as\n    it is merely a manipulation of their skin's texture. They can not change the appearance\n    of their actual clothing, and have to rely on holographic technology in order to change such items.\n    </p> <p>The growth of their abilities mainly relies upon a Clawdite's age. Younglings are only\n    able to change color, a talent that begins at infancy, and baby Clawdites use different hues\n    and colors to indicate their needs to their parents.\n\n    </p> <p>Unlike most shape-changing species, the Clawdite's shifting abilities actually cause them\n    great physical discomfort. While the range of their abilities vary in individuals, with\n    both age and practice, they can work through the pain of changing in order to alter their\n    appearance in more and more extreme ways. Even the most talented Clawdite, however,\n    lacks the fine coordination it would take to mimic a specific individual's appearance precisely.\n    Only a very talented Clawdite is able to sleep and retain their altered form. If a Clawdite\n    is suitably distracted or hurt, and certainly if they are killed, they will revert to their\n    true form.\n\n    </p> <p>It is thought to be impossible for a Clawdite to actually change their body structure or\n    body mass, though it appears that some individual Clawdites managed this feat through unknown\n    means. As most sentient beings' bodies\n    are composed mostly of water, xenobiologists speculated that the Clawdites ability to change\n    may lie in the manipulation of water.\n\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    By nature, Clawdites are quiet and solitary beings, often shunning the company of others\n    unless it benefited them. They view the rest of the galaxy pragmatically, and are\n    often harsh realists who are  mistrustful and suspicious of others.\n    </p> <p>Not all Clawdites use their shape-shifting abilities, but those who do are forced to\n    undertake great physical pain and effort in order to do so. They often learn meditation\n    and concentration techniques, over long periods of time, in order to maximize their capabilities.\n    It is also necessary for Clawdites to treat their skin with specialized oils in order to prevent\n    cracking or tearing, due to the difficulty in physically maintaining their disguises.\n    </p> <p>While in their natural form, they are considered to be indistinguishable from their Zolander\n    brethren, but it is possible to distinguish the two via genetic examination.\n\n    </p> <p>On their homeworld of Zolan, Clawdites are feared and shunned by the Zolanders, who are a deeply\n    religious people. Among their many strong convictions, the Zolanders believe the Clawdites to be impure\n    and sinful. Because of their prejudice, the Zolanders forced the Clawdites to live in slums all\n    across the planet. These ghettos are secured, so that the Zolanders could prevent the Clawdites from\n    spreading. This subjugation continued for centuries on end, and it wasn't until after 4 ABY that they\n    were able to change their situation. After the rise of their new government, the Clawdites began\n    to hold classes for schoolchildren, in order to teach them greater control and efficiency with their\n    abilities.\n\n    </p> <p>The few Clawdites who leave their world most often took advantage of their natural abilities to\n    join militaristic professions, such as spying, assassination, and bounty hunting. Joining groups\n    such as these are the rare occasions where Clawdites afford their loyalty to others, and they\n    see it as a positive contribution to the galaxy. They often seek to protect the liberties of\n    other species, sensing in their pain the disparity their own people suffered.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Zolan was the homeworld of the Zolander species and its Clawdite offshoot. The Zolanders were\n    loyal to the Galactic Republic, but the Clawdites were loyal to the Confederacy of Independent\n    Systems, with the false hope the Confederacy would liberate them from Zolander oppression.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Clawdite is the language of Clawdites, from planet Zolan. It is a modified version of Zolanese.\n    Spoken Clawdite is basically formed by hissing sibilants. Guttural croaks are used in some\n    parts of the sentence.\n  </p>",

      "Description" : "\n    <h4>Defel</h4> <p>\n    The Defel (colloquially known as Wraiths) are barely visible beings native to the Outer Rim\n    planet Af'El who appear to most other species as shadows, re-enforcing the misconception that\n    they are chameleon-like beings or \"living shadows\".\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    Defel are from Af'El, a large, high-gravity, seldom-visited world orbiting the ultraviolet\n    supergiant Ka'Dedus. Since Af'El has no ozone layer, ultraviolet light passes freely to the\n    surface, while other light wavelengths are mostly blocked by the heavy gases in the planet's\n    atmosphere. Thus, all lifeforms on Af'El can see in ultraviolet light ranges, but are\n    blinded by all but the dimmest light in other wavelengths. This is why Defels normally wear\n    a visor when they leave Af'El, and expect to be exposed to daylight at their destination.\n    Compared to other species, they can see exceptionally well in the dark.\n    </p> <p>Defel are short, stocky beings, averaging 1.3 meters tall and nearly as wide. Though they\n    are nearly invisible in normal light, Defel are actually colorful beings. Viewed under\n    ultraviolet light, their fur appear in colors ranging from yellow to blue. Their snouts\n    appear green, with orange, gill-like slits at the base of their jawlines. Elderly Defel\n    lose their ability to absorb light, fading to a dull dark brown under visible light.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    Due to the harsh conditions of Af'El, Defel have a society based on communal resource\n    sharing. Co-operation is vital for survival. As a result, the typical Defel is a tough,\n    independent being, with a strong sense of honor. Defel stand by their word, and refuse\n    to associate with anyone who has broken a promise. The Defel live in underground cities to\n    escape Af'El's violent storms. Their subterranean society has developed highly advanced\n    mining and metallurgical technology, though they have not developed space travel or\n    agriculture on their own.\n    </p> <p>Their homeworld is seldom visited due to the difficulty of escaping its gravity well,\n    making Defel rare outside of the Ka'Dedus system. This rarity, combined with their unusual\n    abilities, mean that much of the galaxy believes they are mythical or supernatural beings.\n    Some of the few Defel who leave their homeworld go in search of adventure, and often\n    employ their natural stealth abilities to become assassins, bodyguards, or thieves.\n    Most Defel who leave Af'El, however, are prized more for their skills in metallurgy, and\n    are contracted by smelting operations and starship manufacturers.\n    </p> <p>The Defel see some trade in meleenium, a rare substance used in durasteel production,\n    which is only found naturally on Af'El. Vulca Minerals sends one\n    ship a year to the Defel to trade fresh food for meleenium.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Af'El is the homeworld to the Defel, whom dwell in underground cities. It is a high-gravity\n    planet with no ozone layer, and it orbits the ultraviolet supergiant Ka'Dedus. Because of\n    the lack of ozone, ultraviolet light passed freely to the surface, while other light wavelengths\n    are blocked by the heavy gases in the planet's atmosphere. Thus, all animals on Af'El can\n    only see in ultraviolet light ranges. A main export of the planet is the metal meleenium\n    used in durasteel.\n    </p> <p>Due to the tremendous velocity necessary for a starship to escape Af'El's gravity well,\n    the planet was rarely visited. It was the only known source of naturally occurring meleenium,\n    and as a result, Vulca Minerals made annual trips to the world. A number of private metallurgists\n    and scientists also visited the world to conduct research.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Defel is the official language of Af'El, used by the native Defel species.\n    Defels are not fond of languages other than their own, so most of them do not learn \n    Galactic Basic Standard unless they have need for it, mainly because they need to leave \n    Af'El. Ironically, more often than not, it is easy to find a Basic-speaking Defel (other than \n    the difficult task of finding a Defel at all).\n  </p>",

    "DEVAR" : {
      "Description" : "\n    <h4>Devaronian</h4> <p>\n    Devaronians are a horned humanoid species from the world of Devaron in the Colonies,\n    a planet of low mountains and deep valleys linked by thousands of rivers. It is\n    believed that they are descended from a race of primates that lived in the mountains\n    of Devaron, and that their horns were a genetic mutation that proved useful in fending\n    off predatory birds.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    The Devaronians are one of the more unusual races in the galaxy, with a dramatic gender\n    dimorphism in appearance and temperament. The males are aggressive by nature, many being\n    described as brash or bull-headed, with typically red-tinted skin and a pair of large\n    horns growing from their heads. They take great pride in their horns, and groom them\n    quite regularly.  Many species feel uncomfortable in their presence, for they resembled the devils of\n    a thousand different myths.\n\n    </p> <p>Female Devaronians are covered in thick fur that range in color from brown to white,\n    hornless and have prominent canine teeth. They are docile, non-aggressive creatures.\n    They tend to be dominant in their culture, being the only ones allowed to participate\n    in government and politics. Several female Devaronians not covered with thick fur reveal\n    two dark circles above the forehead, where the horns usually are in males.\n\n    </p> <p>In addition, the teeth of the males are all sharp incisors, but the females also have molars\n    and prominent canines. One in fifty Devaronian males have two sets of teeth, however, having an\n    inner set of sharp \"male\" teeth and an outer, retractable set of \"female\" teeth. In primitive times,\n    such males were used as solitary scouts by Devaronian tribes, since they could survive on either\n    meat or plants. Males also have an extremely long tongue, though whether females shared this trait\n    is unknown. The teeth are useful for some languages. A Devaronian has to continually and repeatedly\n    retract and extend both sets of teeth to speak Huttese, causing aches over time.\n\n    </p> <p>Their bodies are denser than most humanoids' and as a result they are heavier than their\n    appearance would tend to indicate. Perhaps as a result, they have multiple livers. Their blood is\n    silver based.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    Devaronians have a strong matriarchal culture. The female plays the dominant part in the upbringing\n    of the young and even the only part in local, planetary and inter-planetary politics. Males are considered\n    to be too disruptive to homelife because of their whimsical nature, so the fact that they leave to wander\n    the stars is generaly welcomed by their wives. It does not mean males do not care for their offspring\n    though; they do all they can to support their families back home by sending them as much credits as\n    they can earn. On the rare occasions they re-visit their homeworld it's a time for all-out celebration\n    and much 'disruption' for the family as the males will do their best to have fun times with their\n    relatives. Eating, drinking, giving presents and playing games are some of the key events during those\n    times. Anthropologists have found habits like these to exist within many more cultures galaxy-wide,\n    often on an annual basis.\n    </p> <p>There is also a darker side to Devaronian society: Crime is punished hard and the worst capital offenses\n    are sentenced with the death penalty. Many other species have laws that condemn someone to death but the\n    way one is executed on Devaron is galaxy-wide considered to be the most cruel of all. The accused and\n    convicted criminal will be led into a small ceremonial arena. Then a pack of Quarra, a savage predatory\n    species native to Devaron, is set loose to rip him or her apart. The expression Look to the skies is the\n    last thing the criminal will hear before this gruesome death. By doing so the victim exposes the throat\n    and other soft tissue inviting the Quarra to make the kill fast and, hopefully, less painful.

Because of the masses of wrinkles on their faces, \"outlanders\" often referr to them as \"prune-faces,\" a moniker which Dresselians consider derogatory and highly offensive.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nDresselians are generally fiercely independent, highly valuing personal freedom. Due to this fact, their government is a loose coalition that is determined periodically by popular vote. Their independence also plays a fairly significant role in their interactions with the rest of the galaxy, as they tend to be isolationists and usually opt out of the larger galactic meetings unless specifically encouraged by their Bothan neighbors to attend.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nThe only planet in the Dressel system, Dressel is one of the more idyllic planets in the galaxy. Its lush forests and jungles give the planet a soothing feel and keep the air temperature at quite a pleasant level all year round. The grasslands and deserts allow a wide variety of fauna and flora to flourish, including the planet's only indigenous, sentient species, the Dresselians.\n</p> <p>The planet was originally discovered by the Bothan Askarr clan around two hundred years ago, who decided to leave the Dresselians alone. With many small settlements, the Dresselians were never taken seriously by the rest of the galaxy as they were believed to be a primitive, undeveloped race. Only the Jedi scouts who came to the planet centuries ago saw the great potential in the Dresselians and the Dresselians bestowed great honour upon them. They followed the Jedi into larger galactic affairs and the Dresselians that were later trained to be Jedi were known for their proficiency with the Force.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nThe Dresselian language, Dresselese, has been described by galactic linguists as being somewhat primitive. Due to the fact that they have had a considerable amount of interaction with the Bothans, who initially discovered the Dresselians around 200 years before the Galactic Civil War began, Dresselians speak using many borrowed words from Bothese. Most of the borrowed words are for items which are considered more technologically advanced than those the Dresselians had created themselves.</p>",

They also possess fin-like ears, a pronounced snout and small\n    beady eyes. They can easily walk on their hind legs, their forelegs, or all fours. They used their four\n    hands to help them move through the trees of their homeworld of Malastare. Much of their language\n    is punctuated with knuckle rapping and foot stomping. They are also slender, powerfully built beings\n    with a somewhat humanoid build and a unique method of walking that hailed from the high gravity\n    world Malastare. Their primary means of locomotion were their strong arms, and their lower limbs\n    and feet were used for grappling and other fine motor manipulation. They hardly ever walked on their\n    lower limbs. Although most Dugs may walk on all four limbs, others liked to use their strong arms as\n    legs and their feet as hands like they would normally do.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    Dug society is insular and they turn into self-congratulatory braggarts. Well-known for being a disreputable\n    lot and could often be found in dingy cantinas or dark alleys with all four arms into something illegal.\n    However with a casual glance at their culture on Malastare you could be forgiven for thinking such stories\n    were mere rumours. The arboreal Dugs lived in primitive villages in the trees called \"tree thorps\" and were\n    seemingly in touch with nature, though their culture was actually filled with violence.\n    </p> <p>Due to their oppression under their Gran rulers who colonized Malastare many Dugs often felt the need\n    to throw around their strength in bids to establish dominance. As a result they were known for their\n    ill-tempered demeanour and many were known to be bullying thugs.\n    </p> <p>On their homeworld of Malastare the vast majority of Dugs were little more than laborers toiling for\n    the enrichment of the Gran. With the species excluded from much of the power and money on Malastare many\n    Dugs turned to podracing as their only means to achieve fame and fortune. In all other areas the Dugs\n    were exploited and disenfranchised. Some even obtained transport off their homeworld to seek means of\n    making their fortunes in less Gran dominated regions of the galaxy.\n    </p> <p>When it comes to mating season Dug mating is very reminiscent of some reptiles which may indicate\n    their ancestry. The loose folds of skin around the males neck will inflate during the mating season\n    showing a display of color. An interested female may pester or disturb a male in a few different ways\n    until his balloon-neck deflates with a screech. After this the two are considered mated. Mates remain\n    loyal to each other even though they may bully each other through their time together.\n    </p> <p>Because of their experiences with the Gran the Dugs are xenophobic. If they are seen off-planet they\n    are often seen in groups of their own kind. Most Dugs in the galaxy are reportedly criminals or\n    risk-takers which lead many Dugs into podracing and gambling.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    </p> <p>The planet of Malastare is located within the Malastare System, Dustig Sector in the south of the galaxy.\n    It's sister planet is Lacca and the two planets are the only planets within the Dustig Sector. The sector\n    is surrounded largely by unpopulated sectors except for the Quess Sector. The system of Malastare is\n    located within the south-west of the Dustig Sector.\n    </p> <p>Malastare is a large planet full of a variety of different types of terrain allowing for a large diversity\n    of life to be sustained on the homeworld.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Dug was the native language of the Dug species from the planet Malastare.\n    </p> <p>As Dugs are a subservient species to the Grans, Dug language is not as widely used as Dugs would \n    like to be since the Gran language is usually preferred.\n    </p> <p>Although many Dugs are forced to learn Gran, most of them decide not to learn Basic, hoping to \n    force others to learn Dug language, thus acknowledging their society.\n  </p>",

Duros females give birth\n    to live young, and like the Neimoidians they are born in a larval grub stage, but unlike their cousins\n    who left the raising of their young mainly to the state, the Duros take care of their offspring from\n    birth.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    While usually taciturn, Duros enjoy telling stories about their travels. It is said Duros have a\n    photographic memory when it came to the telling of tales and stories. Many Duros are pilots and\n    explorers, and are adventurous, though sometimes rash. As one of the first cultures to develop\n    a hyperdrive spacecraft (some even believe the first), Duros-charted trade routes are among the\n    oldest hyperspace routes still in use during the Imperial era. Duros are  known for their superior\n    astro-navigational skills. Their affinity for\n    traveling leads many Duros to prefer the honorific title of \"Traveler\" despite their occupation or\n    craft of choice, and addressing them as such is considered good etiquette.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    </p> <p>Their home planet Duro is primarily uninhabited due to massive pollution on the world over time.\n    Instead, it is covered with automated farms for food production.

Although extremely skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology\n    like gliders and catapults, the Ewoks have yet to progress past stone-level technology when discovered\n    by the Empire. They were quick learners, however, when exposed to advanced technology with simple\n    mechanical processes and concepts.\n    </p> <p>Some Ewoks have been removed from their planet and taken as pets or slaves. Others left voluntarily out\n    of a sense of curiosity, especially after the Battle of Endor led to the establishment of New Republic\n    trading posts on the Forest Moon.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    Ewoks are sentient humanoid mammals, averaging about one meter in height, which can provide an\n    advantage when trying to hide. They are covered in fur from head to toe, with brown and black\n    the most common colors. Other Ewoks have near-white or reddish fur, but red fur is supposedly\n    the rarest shade an Ewok can get. Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur, though a few sported stripes.\n    Ewoks have large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possessed two fingers and an opposable\n    thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans.\n\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    The tribal structure of the Ewoks have a Council of Elders ruling over each village, headed by a chief. A medicine\n    man also lives in the Ewok village, a keeper of mystical lore, and a healer to the injured. The warriors of the\n    different tribes wear raggedy garments on the head to signify the Ewok's tribe. The warriors also wear wooden\n    chest shields, the jawbones of tiny animals, and sharp teeth. Some decorate themselves with ornaments such\n    as feathers, necklaces, and pendants, making their body look like a clutter of trinkets.\n    </p> <p>Prominent members of Ewok tribes carry totems to symbolize their rank. The lead warrior wears a headdress\n    made of feathers called the \"white wings of hope\". The eldest son of the tribal leader's family wears a headdress\n    called the \"red wings of courage\". The second son wears the \"blue wings of strength\".\n    </p> <p>The Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations, festivals, and rituals. Ewoks also believe\n    that music enhances their work. Ewoks are resourceful and tended to make use of everything they can get\n    their hands on, so they use a variety of drums, horns, flutes, and other simple instruments in their music.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Endor, also known as Tana among the Ewok species was the cyan gas giant planet orbited by the forest moon of\n    Endor. The name \"Endor\" was also sometimes used for the forest moon.

Ewoks are able to learn and speak other languages, including Basic.\n    Ewokese is related to other tongues on the Forest Moon of Endor. Many linguists suggest that the language \n    developed from the Yuzzum language, which was taught off-world, and which suggests a possible relationship \n    between the Ewoks and Yuzzums. Most Ewoks understand Yuzzum and have no difficulty \n    communicating with Duloks, suggesting that the Dulok language may be a dialect of Ewokese.\n  </p>",

The skin\n    pigmentation of the Falleen change naturally to reflect the mood of the individual;\n    however, the Falleen long ago mastered the ability to change their skin tone at\n    will and use this as something of a covert weapon in their politics, fostering\n    an appearance of calm, for example, when they are really panicking.\n    </p> <p>As a cold-blooded species, the Falleen respect discipline and control,\n    particularly self-control. They tend to shun public displays of emotion, and are\n    very patient. As a result of this attitude, they tend to look down on the more\n    openly passionate, whom they see as lacking self-control. Indeed, the Falleen as a\n    species have a towering sense of superiority which they felt is only right and proper\n    due to their discipline and rigid self-control. They also tend to view Falleen,\n    and not Coruscant, as the civilized and cultural capital of the galaxy. This arrogance\n    make the Falleen something of an isolationist species, and though they are not a rare\n    species, it is rare to find them away from their homeworld.\n    </p> <p>Young Falleen nobles often tour the galaxy for a while to acquire a taste of\n    life away from Falleen. More often than not, though, this merely reinforces the\n    Falleen's biased views and sense of superiority, ensuring that the youth of Falleen\n    never feel the desire to leave home.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Falleen is a planet in the Mid Rim region and home to the Falleen species.

    "GAMORREAN" : {
      "Description" : "\n    <h4>Gamorrean</h4> <p>\n    Gamorreans are porcine humanoids from the lush jungle Outer Rim planet of Gamorr\n    where their technological level is equivalent to lower technology periods that\n    Human civilizations experienced more than 25,000 years before the battle of\n    Yavin. They also colonized the planet Pzob in the K749 system and were the\n    majority sentient species on Lanthrym in the Elrood sector. Their vessels\n    provide only essential amenities as well as shields and weapons. Gamorreans\n    are typically green-skinned with a large powerful physique, and are known\n    to be fierce warriors prized for their great strength and brutality in combat.\n    They are organized into clans headed by a Council of Matrons. In Gamorrean\n    society female sows perform all the productive work while the male boars\n    concentrate on training for and fighting wars. They speak Gamorrese (also\n    called Gamorrean). One of their favorite weapons is a traditional war axe\n    called an arg'garok that is forged specifically for beings of extraordinary\n    strength and a low center of gravity.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    Gamorrean males average about 1.8 meters in height and can weigh more than\n    100 kilograms. They have thick snouts, close set eyes, tusks and two small horns\n    on their heads. Their average body temperature is 40.56 °C (105 °F) and their\n    verbal tones range from 50 to 13,000 hertz.\n    </p> <p>Although a typical Gamorrean is squat, green and heavily built not all\n    share these characteristics. Most Gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration\n    over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration does vary,\n    particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation\n    not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation\n    are possible. Boars tend to have less skin variation and have a greater\n    tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure\n    to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varies evenly between\n    gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The Gamorreans generally put no importance\n    on skin or eye coloration although there are some superstitions linked to\n    certain markings.\n    </p> <p>Not all Gamorreans are heavy and squat. Although this is the most common\n    and generally the desirable appearance in Gamorrean society some individuals\n    are comparatively lean and tall.\n    </p> <p>They are largely viewed as mindless, intellectually inferior brutes by\n    the wider galactic community. This perception may be partly due to\n    their physiology, which makes it nearly impossible for them to speak Galactic\n    Basic. Their vocal apparatus make it impossible for them to speak clearly\n    in any language other than their native language.\n    </p> <p>Gamorreans are typically covered by a number of parasitic bloodsuckers\n    native to Gamorr called morrts. They show great affection for the creatures\n    and consider them adorable pets. The number of morrts that a Gamorrean\n    hosts is related to their status within a clan. A clan Warlord or Matron\n    could have up to 20 of these parasites feeding on them.\n    </p> <p>The Gamorrean diet mainly consists of fungus that grows plentifully on their\n    homeworld. A species of mobile mushrooms called Snoruuk are one of the most widely\n    eaten varieties along with Fug. They drink an alcoholic beverage called Potwa beer.\n    </p> <p>Newly born Gamorreans are called \"feeders\" until they are weaned. Once\n    weaned the younglings are called \"shoats\" until the age of 3 when they began\n    gender specific training. Gamorrean childhood ends after about 6 years from\n    which point they are considered young adults. When they reach the age of\n    13 they are considered mature adults and the boars will go to war. Biologically\n    they are capable of living beyond the age of 45 but the violent nature of their\n    existence means that very few boars reached that age.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    Gamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, a head\n    sow who is the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars\n    are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans,\n    the matrons of the clan perform all the productive work including farming, hunting,\n    manufacturing weapons and running businesses.\n    </p> <p>Females within a clan are all related to each other and can trace their lineage\n    back to a common matriarch. Boars, however, are exchanged between clans at an early\n    age and some will change their allegiance during their adult lives. Clans range\n    in size from a few dozen to over a hundred but typically a clan constitutes about\n    20 sows, fifty boars and the young. The young are mostly born in the spring\n    (\"slushtime\") and the litters typically range between three and nine. The male to\n    female ratio is about ten-to-one with females only being born about every second\n    litter. Despite this, a high fatality rate among boars, due to their violent lives,\n    result in a predominance of older females.\n    </p> <p>Clans own and control areas of land and are always interested in acquiring\n    more. Land is gained by either colonizing unclaimed areas or more commonly taking\n    land from rival clans. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is scarce\n    several clans often lay claim to the same piece of land, and they spend their time\n    fighting over possession. A female typically has up to a dozen husbands during their\n    lifetime since a boar's lifespan is limited by his violent lifestyle.\n    </p> <p>Sows do all the useful work within Gamorrean society and they own and lease\n    all property. They are capable of being as rough as the males and they actively\n    encourage boars to engage in bloody act of violence to demonstrate their virility.\n    Daughters inherit their mother's land evenly and therefore over generations these\n    holdings diminish in size. A matron consolidating land is a critical reason for\n    the ongoing wars between clans.\n    </p> <p>Clan matrons are a select group of sows with the greatest of land who constituted\n    the clan council of matrons. They usually have a number of clan Tusker boars in\n    admiration of their beauty and status. A matron can often be distinguished from\n    a lesser clan sow by the presence of a small number of bodyguards and the relatively\n    large number of morrts that they host. The council of matrons is led by a head sow\n    who is the richest and most powerful of the clan matrons.\n    </p> <p>Sows are responsible for all trading with non-Gamorreans. They are typically\n    interested in obtaining weapons and food supplies with long lives. They will pay\n    for such goods with gold or other precious metals if they have any or by boar mercenary\n    contract.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Gamorr is the agrarian homeworld of the pig-faced Gamorreans, located in the\n    Opoku system of the Outer Rim.\n    </p> <p>Its varied terrain ranges from frozen tundra to deep forests, and is considered\n    quite pleasant by off-worlders. Nevertheless, tourism is highly discouraged to\n    Gamorr because of the vicious lifestyle of ferocious, bloody warfare constantly\n    being waged between rival Gamorrean clans.\n    </p> <p>Prominent mushrooms are also found on Gamorr, as are native coolsap trees.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Gamorrese, or Gamorrean language is the native language of the Gamorrean species \n    from planet Gamorr and colonies like Pzob.\n    </p> <p>Gamorrese is just a bunch of lexicon, mainly nouns and verbs plus a few \n    adjectives, with a primitive syntax. Although apparently there are no declensions \n    in Gamorrean, it is unclear if the word order provides the meaning of the sentences.\n    </p> <p>Gamorreans use Gamorrean words as their names, so that the meaning of a \n    Gamorrean name is, more or less, some kind of threat. Other Gamorreans can \n    be intimidated if they hear \"I am Ortugg\", or \"I'm going to Ortugg you\".\n    </p> <p>Although Gamorrese does not have a sophisticated written language it does have \n    a very basic runic alphabet which is used for record keeping, accounting and \n    genealogy. The runic alphabet is only typically used by educated sows although a \n    fair number of boars can read them slowly. There are known to be several \n    variations of the runic alphabet. Since Gamorreans encountered in the galaxy are \n    mostly males it is generally considered that the Gamorreans have no written language.\n  </p>",

Other notable features of the Givin are their skeletal\n    appearance, and their ability to survive in a vacuum.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    Givin appear to be living humanoid skeletons, because of their hard, pale white\n    \"skin\" and deep sunken black eyes. Though they have four- or five-fingered\n    hands, they have three-toed feet. They carry their arms and legs \"held out\"\n    from their bodies, making their appearance even more bizarre. Some liken their\n    stance to Twi'lek string puppets.\n    </p> <p>Due to a complex system of moons that create atmospheric tidal upheavals on\n    Yag'Dhul, the Givin evolved a hard exoskeleton that can seal all external orifices\n    to protect against sudden depressurization and temperature changes. It also provides\n    protection from physical harm. Thus, Givin have a phobia of exposed skin, and will\n    avoid seeing it in others whenever possible.

These head\n    cones are sensitive enough to pick up subtle changes in another being's\n    electromagnetic emissions from emotional changes, making Gotals natural empaths.\n    The unique nature of these sensors shape Gotal culture, and help individual\n    Gotals carve niches in galactic society ranging from bounty hunters to diplomats.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    Gotals possess cranial horns as receptors to sense electromagnetism and other\n    energy emissions. These nerve-ending filled cones can sense the natural\n    electromagnetic fields produced by Antar, Prindaar, and Antar 4's magnetite-rich\n    crust, allowing the species to operate even in total darkness. Their senses\n    also pick up the electromagnetic auras from other life forms. Gotal hunters can\n    sense their quarry from up to ten kilometers away, and can track herds of quivry\n    for weeks. While hunting, a Gotal can determine the amount, species type, and\n    level of sickness of animals by relying on their cones alone.

Gotal\n    horns are even sensitive enough to pick up such indistinct signals as neutrino\n    emissions. Electronic devices can also be sensed by Gotals: in fact, most\n    droids give off enough electromagnetic emissions to at least annoy a Gotal,\n    and at worst to seriously disorient the horned beings. Consequently, the species\n    is notoriously distrustful of droids. Gotals rely heavily on their cones,\n    with their eyesight and hearing being quite weak, and their sense of smell almost\n    completely absent.\n    </p> <p>At least some Gotals are able to sense the Force with their cones. Nevertheless,\n    standard reference works such as the Catalog of Intelligent Life in the Galaxy are\n    silent on the subject, and the writings of Mammon Hoole described this as a rumor\n    which had \"yet to be proven.\" Other sources indicate that both the Jedi Order\n    and the Galactic Empire had conducted inconclusive research which attempted to train\n    Gotals to sense the Force. The records of the Gotals themselves are split on the\n    issue. Those sources which did describe Gotals sensing the Force varied in their\n    descriptions. Some sources described it as an intense, overwhelming sensation,\n    while others treated it as a mere \"indistinct buzzing.\"\n    </p> <p>Gotals have flat, elongated faces with reddish, heavy-lidded eyes, small, flat\n    noses, and a wide, downturned mouth full of blunt, yellow or white teeth. Their\n    eyes vary in color, with individuals sporting shades of red, orange, yellow,\n    gray, green, and black. Coarse, shaggy fur covers most of their bodies\n    with the exception of the face, chest, and abdomen. Gotals are classified as\n    mammals. Their overall body plan is humanoid, with proportions generally similar\n    to Humans. Some Gotals have four fingers and a thumb with short, conical claws on\n    each digit; others have only four or three digits per limb with much longer claws\n    making up a large portion of each finger. Their skin color varies from\n    gray-brown to black, and their fur came in white or shades of brown or gray.\n    While male Gotals typically have a thick fringe of hair around their cheeks and chins,\n    this is absent in female Gotals. Gotals shed their fur and most Gotals learn\n    to control this process. Under extreme stress or nerves, however—as when surprised\n    or frightened—Gotals can lose control of this process and begin shedding\n    large clumps of fur. Gotals' natural body odor is similar to the smell of\n    mildew and old sweat. Gotals are resistant to the venom produced by members of\n    the Killik species.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    Gotals form intense bonds with one another upon first meeting,[ and love at\n    first \"sight\" is the norm among Gotals, whose empathic nature make the elaborate\n    courtship rituals of other sentients unnecessary. Gotal will mate for life,\n    and will bear young as soon as their lifestyles permitted it. Gotals only\n    speak to each other to relay abstract information, since they have no need to\n    vocally express their emotions (Ironically, since Gotals speak in a non-inflected\n    monotone, they seemed emotionless to Humans and other non-Gotals.)\n    </p> <p>Young Gotals often have trouble assimilating the information arriving from\n    their cones, and are in a constant state of agitated confusion until they learn\n    to filter unwanted signals after about one standard year. Even then, it takes them\n    until the age of twelve to attain emotional maturity, and they can sometimes be\n    nearly psychotic until then. Despite this, Gotal parents are devoted to their\n    children, and young Gotals will have children as soon as they can manage it.\n    Mature Gotals are generally calm and peaceful individuals.\n    </p> <p>Gotal sensory cones allow them to keep their emotions to themselves. They\n    tend to keep a calm and restrained demeanor when dealing with others, speaking\n    of emotions only abstractly. This leads some non-Gotals to assume the species lacks\n    emotion entirely, and many species are uncomfortable around and mistrustful\n    of Gotals. Some feel that they are at a disadvantage when dealing with Gotals and\n    their sensitive head cones, and other, more superstitious species, are wary of\n    what they saw as the Gotals' supernatural powers. Nevertheless, the quirks of\n    Gotals make them effective diplomats, mediators, businesspeople, and gamblers.\n    Unless they sense evil intentions, Gotals were generally diplomatic and polite\n    when interacting with members of other species.\n    </p> <p>Since their natural empathy make them instantly sensitive to the feelings of\n    others, Gotals have little use for government or laws on their homeworld. This\n    results in problems when dealing with non-Gotal societies. For example, no central\n    authority figure can speak for Antar 4 as a whole in a crisis, and no organized\n    Gotal military or police force can act on their behalf. The Gotal Foreign Affairs\n    Commune do act as spokespeople for the Gotals\n    during diplomatic crises, but their role in Gotal government is otherwise uncertain.\n    Though they have little government of their own, Gotals do send representatives to\n    participate in galactic-level governments, and Gotals living among non-Gotals\n    even work in local government bureaucracies. Other species respect the Gotals\n    for their discretion and restraint, but some individuals fear interacting with the\n    horned beings for fear of having their emotional state revealed to others.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Antar 4 is the fourth of six moons orbiting the gas giant Antar and is homeworld \n    of the Gotal race. Located in the Inner Rim, the moon is situated in the Prindaar \n    system.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    The Gotals speak both Basic and Gotal, their native tongue. This language lacks\n    vocabulary to express emotional states, and even their version of Basic avoids such\n    terms and context. Some Gotals speak Basic with a bleating cadence. Non-Gotals\n    are incapable of mastering Gotal because so much of the language relies on unspoken\n    cues sensed with head cones.\n  </p>",

      "Description" : "\n    <h4>Gran</h4> <p>\n    The Gran are sentient mammalian humanoids native to the planet Kinyen, though they\n    have colonies across the galaxy, including settlements on the planets Hok and Malastare.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    Gran can easily be identified by their three eyes and their goat-like snout.\n    Female Gran also have three breasts. Gran are able to sense one another's\n    emotions and disposition by noting subtle changes in body heat and skin color. The\n    Gran have excellent vision, able to resolve more colors than most species, and even\n    able to see into the infrared. Gran have two stomachs, having evolved from herbivorous\n    grazing animals who lived in herds on the mountains and highlands of Kinyen,\n    surviving on the local Goatgrass, for which Gran kept their taste. Gran chew\n    and digest their food quite slowly, savoring the flavor carefully. A single\n    meal can take almost an entire day to finish, but a Gran will often not need to\n    eat for several days afterwards.\n    </p> <p>A recessive genetic mutation sometimes causes some Gran to suffer from misshapen\n    extremities, with hands and feet swelling to abnormal sizes. While not affecting the\n    individual's ability to do finer work, the handicap nonetheless often results in\n    social isolation. Gran scientists intently study the trait to attempt to find a\n    cure.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    The peaceful nature of Gran society is a reflection of their homeworld, Kinyen.\n    Kinyen boasts large and rolling grasslands and highlands, a dense and beautiful\n    forest, and one of the longest and clearest rivers in the Sumitra sector.\n    The beauty of this planet, and the need for primitive Gran to band together for\n    defense against predatory animals, helped the Gran develop strong bonds of home\n    and family in their society (once they became a civilized species, the Grans set\n    aside fenced nature preserves for the carnivores which once threatened them).\n    Grans also mate for life, forming such strong bonds that they generally die\n    within days of a mate's death. It is rare for any Gran to leave his or her\n    planet of origin once they have taken a mate.\n    </p> <p>The Grans are also very protective of their families, and are some of the most\n    devoted parents in the galaxy. This is because of their very powerful and sensitive\n    sight, which can sense the emotions of their mates and their children. Gran society\n    maintains its balance by setting up strict career quotas, and making sure young Gran\n    are educated for a specific job that best serves his or her talents. While other\n    species who value freedom tend to criticize such a rigid social system, to the Gran\n    it is both logical and essential. Gran religion revolves around the worship of\n    the goddess Doellin.\n    </p> <p>Gran have a strong need for companionship—a Gran left alone for too long will go\n    insane or die of loneliness. Generally, they need other Gran for companionship,\n    but some Gran are able to form sufficiently strong bonds with aliens. The most feared\n    punishment among the Gran is exile. Lone, outcast Gran, often wearing black to avoid\n    painful memories of the colorful cities of their homeworld, are generally given a\n    wide berth by experienced spacers. Grans isolated from Gran society are often\n    unreliable, easily bribed, and easily addicted to drugs and liquors, though they are\n    shrewd and often under-estimated. Conversely, Gran within their society are\n    peaceful and amiable, with a keen sense of their place in society, and unselfish\n    instincts putting the greater good ahead of their individual wants.\n    </p> <p>With such close bonds formed throughout the Gran community, it is unsurprising\n    that they concentrated their cities into very small areas, so they are never out of\n    touch with their many relatives. These cities, while hosting a majority of the\n    population of Kinyen, also host the small government of the Gran. The government is\n    a loose group of delegates from the major Gran families who usually controll different\n    aspects of Gran society. One delegate is selected randomly every three and a half\n    standard years to be the leader of this group. It is only due to the very peaceful\n    sensibilities of the Gran race that this system works at all. Indeed, the\n    only known major conflicts between Gran took place very early in Kinyen's history,\n    before 10,000 BBY. Even these wars resulted from matters of survival, rather than\n    strong emotional conflicts between the Gran or rival nations.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Kinyen is an agriworld in the Expansion Region, located on the Corellian Trade\n    Spine. It is the Gran home world, with a recorded history dating back to 10,000 BBY.\n    Though it was an outpost of the violent Rakata during the Pre-Republic era, during its\n    recorded history, the planet has had no local wars.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Gran is the language of the Grans from the planet Kinyen. It has also been exported to\n    Gran colonies such as Malastare or Stend IV.\n    </p> <p>Many Grans learn to speak Basic. However, they also try to make their servants,\n    such as the Dugs, learn Gran language.\n  </p>",

    "GUNGAN" : {
      "Description" : "\n    <h4>Gungan</h4> <p>\n    The Gungans are sentient amphibious humanoids native to the planet of Naboo.\n    Prior to the Invasion of Naboo, the Gungans were a largely isolationist society.\n    They were able to combine machinery with biology. They lived in large bubble-like\n    domes under water. Gungans have strong leg muscles for swimming, and are aided by\n    their long fin-like ears. Their arms end in four-fingered hands, and their feet\n    have three stubby toes each. Females tend to be slightly smaller, with sleeker\n    faces. They often tie their long ears back.\n    </p> <p>The long Gungan face has a tough yet flexible bill for burrowing and rooting\n    out food. They also have long muscular tongues with which they scooped mollusks\n    and lesser amphibians from the Naboo swamps. Their teeth are large and blunt,\n    capable of cracking through shellfish. Their large nostrils completely seal\n    for underwater travel.\n    </p> <p>While most spacefarers would dismiss Gungans as primitives, they developed\n    an advanced, albeit unique, technology. They grow the basic structures of buildings,\n    vehicles and technology and adorn them with artistic flourishes and organic\n    lines. This gives Gungan technology a very fluid, non-rectilinear look.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\n    The Gungans are separated into two races: the lanky orange, yellow or\n    red-skinned Otolla race, and the heavier green-skinned Ankura race.\n    However, they all exhibit many of the same basic physical traits.\n    Starting life as tadpoles, Gungans develop into tall beings with extremely\n    flexible cartilaginous skeletons. Strong leg muscles allow for powerful and\n    quick frog-kick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping\n    ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aid them in swimming,\n    as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They have\n    partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. Green\n    eyes are unusual amongst Gungans.\n    </p> <p>Expressive faces and long bills with flaring nostrils are signatures of\n    Gungan physiology. Lengthy muscular tongues and large blunt teeth allow them\n    to eat lesser amphibians, while a layer of tough skin on the head allow for\n    burrowing. A Gungan's arms end in four digits, and their feet have three stubby\n    toes. Females are smaller with sleeker faces and tend to tie their ears back.\n    Female with light-colored ear flaps are considered attractive by male Gungans,\n    while the ones with dark-colored haillu are thought of as 'boyish'. As male\n    Gungans aged, they develop prominent whiskers, resembling\n    those of a catfish. Both sexes have a lifespan of 65 galactic standard years.\n    </p> <p>Gungans have nostrils that seal when they entered the water. They also boast\n    very strong lungs, allowing them to both hold their breath for extended periods of\n    time and to withstand the pressure of deep water, along with well-padded kneecaps\n    and powerful calves and legs for increased swimming speed. However, because they\n    are so well-adapted to their watery environment, their skin dries easily in hot\n    and arid climates.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\n    Utilizing their own unique phraseology, Gungans established a rather successful\n    history of scholarly excellence, albeit unknown to the galaxy at large. Among their\n    achievements include the epic poem Das Depu Epu Sea, or Deep Dark Water. This ode\n    to Da Beauty Al'Round was a source of great pride to these noble beings.\n    </p> <p>Gungan alpha-males often exhibit a series of oral clicks when aggravated or\n    angered. The Gungan military is made up of mostly male volunteers.\n    </p> <p>Gungans were basically a generous and peaceful people until the Trade Federation\n    invaded. They loved to have visitors and warmly welcomed them; however, they would\n    remain suspicious until the visitors had earned their respect.\n    </p> <p>Gungans are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their peaceful culture. They\n    have very strict laws, and will go to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed\n    a minor crime. Vandals, for example, could be given a sentence of exile, caning, or\n    even stoning.\n    </p> <p>If a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very difficult for them to return.\n    If they do manage to return legally, they will often be subjected to heavy\n    discrimination. This can make life very difficult for them and can go on for\n    months or years, until their past offenses disappear from memory. In addition,\n    returning back to the settlement from which they were exiled illegally will sometimes result\n    in the death penalty, especially if they bring along outsiders. It usually requires\n    a significant deed to not only have their exile revoked, but also be welcomed back\n    to the fold.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\n    Naboo (pronounced /nə'bu/) is a planet that is the sector capital of the Chommell\n    sector near the Outer Rim territories. It is a largely unspoiled world with large\n    plains, swamps and seas\n    </p> <p>Naboo is a geologically unique world in the galaxy. A plasmic molten outer core\n    surrounded an inner core, believed to be composed primarily of a nickel-iron alloy,\n    with very small amounts of some other elements. These elements are found in abundance\n    in other chemical compositions in the galaxy, but it is the unique properties of the\n    plasma which interested astrophysicists, plasma which the two primary civilizations\n    harnessed to supply clean and efficient energy highly valued throughout the galaxy.\n    </p> <p>The plasmic magma \"seethes and bubbles\" from the center of the planet carving l\n    abyrinths of winding tunnels and caverns similar to lava tubes of traditional magma\n    flows. Much of these abyssal labyrinths are submerged in great underground oceans,\n    which are home to immense aquatic animals and creatures that are never seen on the\n    surface. Animals such as the colo claw fish, opee sea killer, sando aqua monster and\n    others inhabited this underworld realm. Gungans dominate these \"underwaterways,\"\n    using them as a highway of sorts between their surface Holy Places and their underwater\n    cities. The Gungans also use these tunnels for trading between Bubble cities.\n    </p> <p>Plasmic eruptions find their way to the porous crust of the planet, affecting\n    geographic features there such as mountain chains and plate tectonics.\n    </p> <p>The surface of Naboo is covered by dense swamps, rolling grass plains, seas and\n    verdant hills. The largest mountain chain, the Gallo Mountains, bisects the largest\n    continent and divides the great grass plains of the north from the Lianorm Swamp and\n    bayous in the south. South of the Lianorm Swamp is the great Paonga Sea, where at\n    the bottom lay the Gungan city of Otoh Gunga. The Lake Country is an area known for\n    its natural beauty, and is home to many vacation estates.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\n    Gungan Basic, also called Gunganese, is the language spoken by the Gungans of the \n    planet Naboo. It is a language mostly derived from Naboo settlers' language, Basic, \n    spoken in an accent. Occasionally, a word from Old Gungan will appear in dialogue, a \n    term usually without any obvious meaning unless translated.\n    </p> <p>Humans can usually understand it and, similarly, Gungans can understand Humans \n    speaking Basic (even in written form). Most one-syllable words pertaining to the self \n    will contain a suffix of -sa, for example, \"We-sa\" and \"You-sa\". Many one-syllable \n    words ending in a consonant will end with -u.\n  </p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Herglic</h4> <p>\n\nThe Herglics, alternatively known as Koodans, are a race native to the planet Giju. They are water-based mammals, and developed hyperdrive and a trade based empire in the Colonies Region before encountering the Duros. Herglics are pleasant and peaceful, but they have an addiction to gambling and games of chance. Herglics are a very large species and are sensitive about their size.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nHerglics are large bipeds that appear to have evolved from water-dwelling mammals. Most of the evidence of their water borne ancestry has been bred out so that, for example, fins and flukes have been replaced with arms and legs. They do, however, still breathe through a blowhole on the top of their heads. The hauum sound of a Herglic clearing their blowhole is a common Herglese word throughout the Tapani sector where it is used with emphasis to preface a significant remark.\n</p> <p>They are tall, extremely wide, and have smooth, hairless skin that ranged in color from pale blue to black although some have pale pink skin. A few Herglics display white stripes down the sides of their head and arms.\n\n</p> <p>Herglics are generally quite sensitive about their large size. Since most other sentient species in the galaxy are smaller than they are and most facilities are designed to accommodate Human dimensions, Herglics tend to feel somewhat self-conscious and out of place when removed from their community or their ships. Their bulky size means that typically a Herglic will take up two seats in a restaurant and the majority of doorways require some maneuvering. Despite this they are typically easygoing in nature and enjoy meeting new people and visiting exotic locations.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nThe Herglics of Giju were a technologically advanced race early in galactic history, reaching the stars of neighboring systems and began colonization in about the same time period as the Corellians reached theirs. There is some archaeological evidence that an early Herglic trading Empire achieved a superior level of technology that was not paralleled during the Rebellion era.\n</p> <p>Ruins are found on some Herglic colony worlds that contained non-functioning machines that appeared to harness gravity to perform an unfathomed function. This early Empire, however, collapsed a millennium before the Herglics made contact with the wider galaxy and most records were lost.\n</p> <p>The Herglics are natural explorers and traders. During the early days of the Galactic Republic the angular freighters characteristic of Herglic trading vessels became a common sight throughout the galaxy but contact with the Republic remained minimal. They have an inquisitive but practical nature and calm persona that help them interact with other species and make them a welcome member of the Galactic community.\n\n</p> <p>With the rise of the Galactic Empire Giju's manufacturing centers were among the first to be nationalized by the Emperor's New Order. The normally docile Herglics tried to fight the subjugators but after significant slaughter and realizing that their resistance was in vain they decided to be pragmatic and submit totally to the will of the Emperor. Fortunately they stopped resisting and surrendered before the destruction of Giju's infrastructure. During the Galactic Civil War period a number of Herglics purchased their way into the Tapani nobility when House Cadriaan began selling titles to nonhumans.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nGiju is the Herglic homeworld. Located in the Colonies, it is on the Rimma Trade Route and is one endpoint of the Giju Run. Giju is an aquatic-type world with large bodies of water and associated terrain including: expansive oceans, islands, marshes, and glaciers. Giju has many spaceports and manufacturing centers.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nHerglese or Herglic is the language of the Herglics from the planet Giju. Most Herglics also learn to speak Basic, so Herglese is not quite extended.\n</p> <p>Due to the influence of Herglic trading within the Tapani sector several Herglic words have been incorporated into the local vocabulary.  </p>",

    "ITHORIAN" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Ithorian</h4> <p>\n\nIthorians are a mammalian herbivorous sentient species from the planet Ithor. They are commonly called \"Hammerheads\" by less sensitive beings because of their long, curving neck and T-shaped head. They find this nickname offensive.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nIthorians have two mouths and four throats, allowing them to speak in stereo. Female Ithorians have two humps on the back of their head, while males have only one. They have glossy, usually brown flesh. They stand roughly between 1.8 to 2.3 meters from eyestalk to toe. Their reflexes and coordination are somewhat slower than that of average humanoids.\nIn addition to allowing them to speak their unique stereophonic language, the Ithorians' four throats also have the ability to violently expel air, resulting in a deafening and potentially concussive scream. Although even common Ithorians possess this strange talent, those with Force training can push enough power into their sonic bellow to shatter iron and shred plasteel. Despite this fact, most Ithorians go their entire lives without ever resorting to violence, and so the ability remained relatively ambiguous.\n\n</p> <p>Ithorian youths are known as \"pupa,\" and are commonly glassy-eyed, appendageless and limber, until they metamorphosize. After the molt, Ithorians lose an aural flap and every locomotion tube, gain lumps, craters in their craniums and an appetite for ant-flies. An adult Ithorian can father several thousand offspring.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nIthorians worship the \"Mother Jungle,\" a spiritual entity embodying the lush, tropical ecology of their world, Ithor. They are generally devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists, devoting much time to contemplating their ecology, studying plants and their uses and the overall respecting of all living things. Most Ithorians never set foot on their own planet, instead living in floating cities above their world called herdships. Only three of their continents have been explored and harvested, the other two never having been touched by Ithorian hands. This demonstrates their extreme belief in the protection and sustaining of their environment which is apparent through their \"Law of Life.\"\n</p> <p>The Ithorians practice a communal form of government. Each herdship is autonomous and self-supporting. However once every Ithorian season (about five standard years), the herds gather for \"the Meet,\" a grand gathering above the surface of their world, where the herd ships would join each other in a festival and regal ceremony.\n\n</p> <p>Ithorian’s curious and gregarious nature means that many find their way off-planet via their floating herdship’s space-worthy counterparts. Many become galactic traders, traveling the stars either independently or as part of their herdship. They will only resort to violence if threatened, and they are more likely to use their sonic bellow than a weapon. Because of their mild demeanor, most Ithorians avoid war in general, although the Rebel Alliance did boast a few among its ranks. Their pacifistic nature means that they refuse to touch things that come as a result of bloodshed.\n</p> <p>When dealing with others, Ithorians are always supremely polite. They are very conversational and have profound respect for the views of others. Though often described as likable and friendly, many sentients find them altogether dull. Even when they have disagreements, Ithorians are unlikely to discuss their grievances with anyone unless the offending party is present. To do otherwise was considered rude.\n\n</p> <p>Despite their reputation, not all Ithorians are so peaceful. Rarely, violent and unruly Ithorians are born and subsequently banished from their homeworld or herdship. Such Ithorians often become drifters and bounty hunters.\n\n</p> <p>Within Ithorian society, there is a priestly group known as nature priests who commune with the \"Mother Jungle\" and have a deeper connection to the Ithorian homeworld. Within the trading guilds themselves, Merchantates are present who dealt with business matters.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nIthor is the fourth planet located in the Ottega system of the Mid Rim. One of the oldest members of the Galactic Republic, it is a planet full of lush life, and the planet's surface has not a touch of civilization on it. The Ithorians themselves, otherwise known as \"Hammerheads,\" built great floating cities that do not harm the surface, which they consider to be sacred. Entry upon the surface is forbidden, unless one stays there permanently. Some Ithorians such as the Oracle are compelled to go down to the planet surface, however, as they \"hear the call\" of Mother Jungle, the Ithorian religion's personification of Ithor's world-spanning jungle. The surface of the planet of Ithor plays host to numerous plants, including the bafforr tree, which possess telepathic capabilities. The planet contained andurite stone, and every three Ithorian years was the center of the Time of Meeting. The planet has many moons in its night sky.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nIthorese is the language of the Ithorians. Because the Ithorians have two mouths and four throats, the language has a peculiar stereophonic aspect to it. This stereo effect also appears when Ithorians speak Basic. The language is incredibly difficult to learn.</p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Jawa</h4> <p>\n\nJawas are short rodent-like natives of Tatooine. They are passionate scavengers, seeking out technology for sale or trade in the deep deserts in their huge sandcrawler transports. They have a reputation for swindling, as they have a penchant for selling old equipment such as outdated faulty droids to moisture farmers. However, they are extremely passive beings, and hardly put up any resistance to colonists of their planet unlike the other natives the Sand people, instead seeing foreigners as an excellent business opportunity.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nJawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to wear other colors. Other notable features include their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese.\n</p> <p>Through the study of corpses and skeletal remains, Baobab xenobiologists discovered that Jawas appear to be gaunt, rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow eyes. Conflicting research suggests that Jawas and Tusken Raiders, two native species of Tatooine, originally evolved from the same extinct species, the Kumumgah, as both have common genetic markers, while other research suggests Jawas originated from humans.\n\n</p> <p>At all times, Jawa faces remain obscured by a shroud of cloth to retain moisture, hide their identity and dissipate their body heat. Polished orange gemstones are embedded within the fabric to protect the Jawas’ sensitive vision from the bright sunlight. The only physical parts that are exposed are their hands, which have tufts of fur on the palms. Jawas are renowned for their incredibly potent odor. Repulsive to most species, this odor contains incredible amounts of information such as other Jawas' identity, health, clan lineage, last meal, maturity, arousal and even their mood. Their odor is compounded by a mysterious solution Jawas dip their clothes in to retain moisture, and their view of bathing as being a waste of precious water, which attracts swarms of insects to gather in the recesses of their hoods. Jawas evolved several important survival traits, such as exceptional night vision and a strong immune system. A Jawa’s normal body temperature is 46°C (116 F) which results in a high metabolism and an efficient digestive system that draws all the needed nutrients from the Jawa staple diet of hubba gourd.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nJawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement, where the dry climate of Tatooine preserves almost all debris. Most non-Jawas regard the Jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most Jawas actually find pleasing.\n</p> <p>The Jawa’s unofficial motto is not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it. And this is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being Jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nTatooine (pronounced /tætu'in/) is a desert world and the first planet in the binary Tatoo star system. It is part of the Arkanis sector in the Outer Rim Territories. It is inhabited by poor locals who mostly farm moisture for a living. Other activities include used equipment retailing and scrap dealing. The planet is on the 5709-DC Shipping Lane, a spur of the Triellus Trade Route, which itself connects to the Sisar Run. The planet is not far from the Corellian Run. It has its own navigation system. The planet acquired a bad reputation, often being viewed as the cesspool of the galaxy due to the large number of criminals who can be found there.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nJawaese is the native language of the Jawa species from Tatooine. It is mainly composed of meaningless syllables, supported by pheromone produced scents, which allow it to be understood. Jawa communication is based in these scents to such a high degree that the scent a Jawa gives out can tell others about that Jawa's mood.\n</p> <p>Jawas cannot pronounce Basic language or many other extended languages due to several vocal limitations of the species. They can, however, learn to understand most existing languages.\n</p>",

    "KLATOO" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Klatooinian</h4> <p>\n\nKlatooinians are a humanoid species from the planet Klatooine, located in the Si'Klaata Cluster. For most of their history, they were closely associated with the Hutts, as criminal henchmen, soldiers, and slaves. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, however, some Klatooinians began to break away from their servitude.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nThe Klatooinians are tall, humanoid beings. Their skin is rough, with color ranging from olive green to dark brown. They have a flat nose and a canine muzzle, with dark eyes under their thick heavy brows. The severe desert climate of their homeworld has made their species strong and enduring. To survive in their hostile world was a mark of great physical and mental strength. That is why the Klatoonians respect and admire the elderly and experienced of their kind.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nThe Klatooinians are a proud people and are traditionalists, used to following the traditions laid by their ancestors. They also have a strong religious upbringing, that can tie them down, as a species or a clan, to another entity, be it a Hutt or a crime syndicate. When a Klatooinian makes a vow, you can rest assured that he will do anything in his power to complete their vow. But you can also be assured that if a Klatooinian ever vowed to kill you, you will be hunted till the Klatooinian or you had been killed. Thus is the way of their species.\n</p> <p>This religious steadfast pride and loyalty, coupled with their strong statures, has made the Klatooinians ideal for guard duty, since anyone with an ounce of intelligence would think twice about trying to rush a Klatooinian. They have been a favorite to crime syndicates and Hutts for their steadfast loyalty, and you would never have to think twice about them if they made a vow.\n\n</p> <p>Klatooinian civilization is notable for its strong belief in tradition and the wisdom of elders. The center of their culture is the Fountain of Ancients, a slowly evolving natural glass sculpture on Klatooine's Derelkoos Desert. Long before the formation of the Galactic Republic, primitive Klatooinians discovered the Fountain, and revered it as a symbol of patience, tenacity, and the idea of strength coming from age. \n</p> <p>Their society is ruled by a Council of Elders, which grants young Klatooinians few rights. Klatooinians are taught the myths and traditions of their people from a young age, in a process which tended to suppress individuality. At the age of ten, they would be sold into servitude, with the most rebellious youths sent into the harshest conditions. \n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nKlatooine is a desert planet, located within the Si'Klaata Cluster, and the homeworld of the Klatooinian race, found deep in Hutt Space.\n</p> <p>The Klatooinian is a race native to Klatooine, indentured to the Hutts since before the rise of the Old Republic. Along with the Vodran and Nikto races, the Klatooinians have served the Hutts since the battles against Xim the Despot. They are a tall, humanoid race with flat, canine faces and coarse skin. The Klatooinian culture is strongly tied to traditional values, and has been as patient and tenacious as the Fountain of Ancients. They also, like the Fountain, strove to grow stronger with age. The Klatooinians have often referred to themselves as the Children of the Fountain, since they have developed many of the Fountain's characteristics. At the age of ten, every Klatooinan is sold into servitude, usually to local governments. Especially troublesome youths are sold into slavery. This helps the young Klatooinans learn to respect and admire their elders and the traditions of their people. However, they have forever been under the oppression of the Hutts. Like the Fountain of the Ancients, the Klatooinans hope that they can endure long enough to grow strong with age and shed the Hutt yolk.\n</p> <p>The Fountain of the Ancients is a unique natural phenomenon located in the center of the Derelkoos Desert. In a bowl-shaped depression, liquid wintrium seeps from the desert sand and begins to crystallize. As it solidifies over several millenia, the wintrium forms wonderful shapes and patterns, continually expanding and growing. Because of its hardness, the Fountain's shape can be altered only by powerful weaponry, and has stood untouched for as long as the Klatooinian race can remember. The Fountain's continually growth, increasing strength, and tenacity have instilled similar values in the Klatooinian people. It also has certain religious connotations to them. Wintrium this glass-like substance remains in liquid form at very low temperatures, and can take as much as 10,000 years to solidify under normal conditions. It is found in the Derelkoos Desert of Klatooine, where it seeps from the desert and creates incredibly beautiful, natural sculptures. The Klatooinans call the landmark the Fountain of the Ancients, and revere it for its tenacious and wonderful existence.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nThe Klatooinian language was once the native language of the Klatooinians, the native people of Klatooine. By the latter days of the Galactic Republic, it was a dead language.  Klatooinians now speak Huttese, the language of the Hutt.</p>",

Having adapted to their sun-scorched, vegetation-deprived world, the Kubaz learned to survive off their world's native insect population. Filled with two rows of teeth for gnashing their food, the Kubaz trunk also functions as a highly sensitive nose. Green-black skinned, Kubaz have short bristly hair growing from their heads and they stand upon two-toed feet. Having evolved on their homeworld of Kubindi, a planet which orbited a blue star, the Kubaz are highly sensitive to red wavelengths. When traveling to planets with a red or yellow star, the Kubaz are forced to don protective eye wear to avoid damaging their sensitive eyes.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nThe Kubazi society is based on a clan structure which dwells in underground nests. Ruled by a queen, each clan takes the name of the queen they are descended from. Developing a non-verbal language of hand gestures which indicated their intentions, Kubaz are able to speak Galactic Basic Standard, though with a strong nasally accent. When interacting with other species, some Kubaz will share certain hand signals with non-Kubaz in order to ease communications. Touching the nose, head, or shoulders can indicate intent, direction, and number. Obsessed with tact and decorum, the Kubaz place a high emphasis on the family unit and proper courtesies, displaying truthfulness to a fault. Valuing art and literature with such vigor as to sometimes practice smuggling of great works, the Kubaz do not find such pursuits to be wrong or unlawful.\n</p> <p>Due to their habitual diet on Kubindi, the Kubaz have poor relations with other sentient insectile species such as the Geonosians.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nKubindi is a terrestrial world and home to the Kubaz. A planet that orbits a blue giant star that emits powerful solar flares, Kubindi is regularly hit with this radiation, causing erratic weather patterns and making the world dry and arid.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nKubazian, or Kubazi, is the native language of the Kubaz species from Kubindi. Most Kubaz are fluent in both Kubazi and Basic, although only literate in their own language.\n</p> <p>Kubazi language is very nasal, and Kubaz usually have a high-pitched accent when speaking other languages, such as Basic. The Kubaz, however, learn new languages quickly.  </p>",

    "LEPI" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Lepi</h4> <p>\nThe Lepus carnivorus, more commonly known as Lepi, are a species of sentient rabbit, ranging in color from green to dark blue. Their most distinctive features are long ears and feet and buck teeth. Native to the planet Coachelle Prime, their high reproductive rate forced them to colonize the entire star system to avoid overcrowding. The Lepus carnivorus are typically gregarious individuals, although prone to bursts of anger if their family or species are insulted. Lepi are constantly in motion and are known for their speed.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nThe Lepus carnivorus are sentient bipedal lagomorphs with large ears and feet. They have lanky frames, with males averaging 1.9 meters in height, while the smaller females average 1.6 meters. The strong legs of the Lepi are capable of great speeds as well as delivering powerful kicks, often used in fights to bludgeon their opponents. Lepi are covered in short fur that ranged in color from green to dark blue to white. Lepi also have tails, although these differ in length from stubby to quite long.\n\n</p> <p>The Lepus carnivorus have large eyes—likely adapted for dark warrens—which give them sharp vision. That occasionally leads to the misconception that Lepi consume space carrots, which are known to improve eyesight. However, most Lepi prefer various forms of meat, such as hambones. Some Lepi even claim to be carnivorous. A number of long whiskers grow from their short snouts. Long incisors, occasionally referred to as \"buck teeth,\" jut from their jaws, useful in their omnivorous diets. The long ears of the Lepi are very sensitive and occasionally colored in different shades, such as pink fur.\n\n</p> <p>The Lepus carnivorus have a very high metabolism such that they are virtually always in motion, giving them an appearance of flightiness. That skittishness is also influenced by their evolution from high-strung herbivores; their \"fight-or-flight\" instinct very much favored flight.\n\n</p> <p>Lepus carnivorus sexually mature around age ten, when they are considered young adults. Females give birth in prodigious numbers; mothers often have up to three dozen offspring in their lifespan. Lepi reach old age around sixty to seventy-four, after which they are considered venerable.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nLepus carnivorus society revolves around the vast warrens they build under the surface of their planets. Larger families live in their own smaller burrows. Lepi are fiercely loyal and proud of their families. They are quick to anger and prone to violence, especially in reaction to insults to their family or species. Their awkward appearance make them prone to mockery, and they are particularly sensitive to being referred to as rodents. However, as a whole, Lepi are typically a gregarious species, quick witted with a strong sense of humor.\n</p> <p>The Lepi are often curious and impulsive, leading many to seek out adventure far from their homeworlds. That also stems from a desire to rise above the insults they often receive. It is common among Lepi to find a determination to achieve great deeds not only for personal fame, but also to redeem their species in the eyes of the galaxy.\n\n</p> <p>Little is known of Lepi religion, but their exclamation \"heavenly hutches\" suggested belief in an afterlife. Some Lepi also carried lucky charms.\n\n</p> <p>Lepi names were typically one word, with examples including Augdon, Gagen, Javilla, Lupher, Maximort, Nevlin, Roonis, Saper, Zylo, and Trixx.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nCoachelle Prime is a planet in the Mid Rim, not far from the Centrality.  It is home to the rabbit-like Lepi, who live underground in massive warrens.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nThe native language, both written and oral, of the Lepi is Lepese, or Lepp. However, that quickly became secondary to Basic as the language of preference.  Non-Lepi are capable of learning the language. Lepi are prone to wild gesticulations when talking amongst themselves. </p>",

    "MONCAL" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Mon Calamari</h4> <p>\n\nThe Mon Calamari (also known as Calamari, Calamarians, Mon Cal, Mon Calamarians, or rarely Mon Cala) are one of the sentient species indigenous to the world of Dac.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nOn average, a member of the species stands between 1.3 to 1.8 meters tall and also smells of salt and the sea. They are a fish-like amphibious humanoid species with salmon-colored skin, webbed hands, high-domed heads and huge, fish-like eyes. They are equally capable of breathing both on land and in water with them being at home in either environment. Male Mon Calamari have protrusions on their chin called \"barbels\" which grow more numerous with age. Most Mon Calamari have salmon-colored skin, often mottled with light and dark patterns, though examples of other skin colors are known. The Mon Calamari are able to descend to depths of up to 30 meters below sea level without requiring breathing or pressure apparatus. Though they can breathe water, they find it somewhat uncomfortable, and use organic gills whenever possible. Mon Calamari can stay underwater for an indefinite period of time, although a frightened Mon Calamari, particularly a juvenile, can drown underwater. They also do not need to decompress when resurfacing.\n</p> <p>Their hands, apart from being webbed, also feature five claw-tipped fingers; one opposable thumb with two more shorter claw-like protrusions, two long middle fingers, and two extremely short outer fingers. As an additional feature, Mon Calamari hands also present three suction-cup like holes on their palms.\n\n</p> <p>Mon Calamari can swivel their eyes independently from one another, focusing on two areas at once. Mon Calamari see in different wavelengths than Humans, making it difficult for one species to view visuals designed for the other and vice versa. Their eyes are often used to express emotion; staring with the left eye is a way of showing surprise, while staring with the right eye is either a challenge to fight or an expression of love, depending on the circumstances.\n\n</p> <p>Their children range from the age of 1-11 with them being considered young adults by 12-16 and full adults between 17-40. A Mon Calamari between the age of 41-57 is considered middle aged and old by 58-79 whilst those above the age of 80 are held to be venerable.\n</p> <p>Due to their fish-like appearance, the Mon Calamari are referred to by the somewhat derogatory Deal-slang expression \"Mon Cals in a fishbowl\", which refer to the act of making several big and easy deals from naïve or less-than-intelligent clients.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nThe Mon Calamari have developed a very advanced and civilized culture. Art, music, literature, and science show a creativity surpassed by few in the galaxy. Mon Calamari literature depicts stars as islands in a galactic sea. This shows a passionate longing to explore space and discover other civilizations. In terms of temperament, they are both soft spoken and gentle. They are extremely tempered to the point that they are slow to anger and have the remarkable ability to maintain their concentration without being distracted by emotional responses. Other notable personality traits included being inquisitive and creative as well as being quiet. In addition, they are known for a near-legendary quality of being both determined and dedicated. This means that once a Mon Calamari decides on a course of action, they are not easily swayed from that decision. As they are idealistic and daring, they often fixate themselves on causes that seem hopeless or lost from the start. As such, they have a great deal of enthusiasm and spirit which is often masked by their quiet, orderly exterior. Ultimately, a Mon Calamari often attempts to demonstrate that even dreamers and thinkers are capable of daring and bravery when the need arises. This means that they often think of the needs of the society and believe in performing the greater good to the point that they placed it above the good of the individual.\n</p> <p>They have developed a reputation for being one of the most skilled starship designers in the galaxy. This partly stems from the fact that they see everything as a work of art rather than being a simple tool or weapon. Their technology is notable for being unique, yet comparable to that of the other inhabitants of the galaxy. While their starships are significantly different from those of other races, they are in fact more efficient in design. However, such vessels tend to be extremely difficult to construct. The mathematically-minded Givin cannot stand the Mon Calamari spaceships, as they are too organic and not geometric enough.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nDac, as it is called in Mon Calamarian, Quarrenese, and Basic, also known as Mon Calamari and sometimes simply called Calamari or Mon Cala, is a planet in the Calamari system of the Calamari sector, located in the Outer Rim. It is home to a wealth of sentient species: the Mon Calamari, the Quarren, the Moappa, the Amphi-Hydrus, and the Whaladons. Mon Calamari is the name given to the planet by Human explorers from the Galactic Republic who first discovered and revealed the world to the rest of the galaxy. The native species refer to the planet as Dac. The planet is a shining bluish-white orb from space, due to its ocean-covered surface. It is home to 27.5 billion Mon Calamarians and Quarren, as well as surrounded by the impressive Mon Calamari Shipyards.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nThe Mon Calamari language is shared with the Quarren though many members of the species adopted Basic as their common tongue. In fact, they are able to speak both of these languages with ease though in the case of Basic, their vocal cords often produce a gurgling sound when they speak in that tongue.</p>",

Their appearance gives the impression that they are dead rather than alive. They believe strongly in honor and battle and craft small, short-bladed weapons called Tehk'la blades. They live on the planet Nagi, beyond the borders of both the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire in the satellite galaxy known as Firefist. Despite their isolation, a number of Nagai ventured into the wider galaxy, with some becoming Jedi Padawans in the days of the Republic.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nNagai are driven by a strong sense of personal honor, tempered by their own individualities. They fear nothing aside from losing their freedom and have little concerns for individuals outside of their own families, only aiding others when bound by honor or seeking personal gain.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nNagi is a planet in the Unknown Regions, located in the dwarf galaxy known as Firefist that orbits the known galaxy. Even by 130 ABY, few non-Nagai knew the world's location. It is one of five planets in its solar system.\n</p> <p>Nagi is an arid world, and quite mountainous, characterized by very high mountain peaks separated by deep, wide valleys. The thin upper atmosphere is relatively ineffective at blocking solar radiation, and the high peaks of the world are bathed in it. As a result, the deep valleys, which are often cast in shadow by the towering mountains, are the site of the Nagai's cities. At the height of their civilization just prior to the Tof invasion, Nagai cities were composed of wire and crystal, and were perceived as beautiful.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nNagaian is the native language of the Nagai species from Nagi. It is a language characterized by slight variations of tone and pitch, resulting in what some regarded as a musical, lilting quality.\n</p> <p>Most Nagai are fluent in both Nagaian and Basic, although they are only literate in their own language.

Although they established settlements across their aquatic homeworld, most Nautolan civilization is found in the Sabilon region.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nNautolans possess a physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. They stand an average of 1.8 meters, have smooth green, blue, or brown skin, and large black or dark maroon eyes with lids that are seldom used. They are capable of breathing underwater; however, unlike other water-based species, Nautolans do not experience difficulties out of water.\n</p> <p>Nautolans possess exceptional olfactory and pheromone-sensing skills, enhanced by head-tresses. These tendrils are used to detect the emotional state of another being, but are most effective underwater. Within Nautolan culture, the ability to sense pheromone changes is an essential part of the communication process. All Nautolans have fourteen sensory tentacles and multiple hearts, which are capable of beating separately.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nLittle is known about Nautolan culture, as few Nautolans leave Glee Anselm, but their music is occasionally found amongst savvy music collectors. Nautolan music is composed of sustained notes held in irregular patterns with occasional pauses. These pauses are considered the most important part of the music to the Nautolans, causing non-Nautolan listeners to misunderstand their artistic intent.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nGlee Anselm is a peaceful water planet in the Mid Rim. The planet's surface is largely covered in water or swamps, with only a few clear landmasses spotting the surface. The planet has very frequent seasonal changes, causing it to be ravaged by intense storms and hurricanes.

      "Description" : "<h4>Neimoidian</h4> <p>\n\nNeimoidians are a species of humanoids that are distant genetic relatives of Duros. They are native to the planet of Neimoidia and also live on colony worlds in the same sector like Cato Neimoidia, Deko Neimoidia, and Koru Neimoidia. They have a reputation for greed and cowardice. Neimoidians place tremendous value on wealth and material possessions, and will go to great lengths to gain money and power; however, they are very easily intimidated, and hated combat. They are famous for running the Trade Federation, a massive corporate entity.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nSince the Neimoidians are distant genetic relatives of the Duros, they retain many similarities to them, including basic form, noseless faces, and green-blue skin (though Neimoidians tended to be grayer). Their eyes also have pupils that split horizontally, and they are distinguished by small lumps on their foreheads and down-turned mouths. Their sense of smell comes from glands under their eyes. These genetic differences are attributed to the distinct features of their homeworld, Neimoidia, including its gravity, which is heavier than Duro. Additionally, the planet's star is dimmer, and the planet itself is humid and widely shrouded by fog and mist.\n</p> <p>Neimoidian skin often takes on a mottled look if the being is too self-indulgent or often prone to great stress. A Neimoidian's lung pods will expand and contract convulsively under great stress, leading to an old saying characterizing Neimoidians as the only sentient species with an entire organ devoted to worrying. Nauseated Neimoidians' skin turns pink. The Neimoidians have five fingers and two clawlike toes.\nNeimoidians are born in a larval state called a \"grub\" form. Although hive-mothers have cloacas, the grubs are born live and not from eggs.\n\n</p> <p>Many Duros take great offense at being compared to their Neimoidians cousins.  The classic example of what not to say details an employer for a shipping company who was curious as to why a Neimoidian was applying for a pilot's position when it was, in actuality, a Duros. The reason for the offense is obvious: Neimoidians tend to be cowardly, greedy, and fearful of death, while Duros are an adventurous, gregarious, and peaceful race.\n\n</p> <p>It is well-known that Neimoidians are notorious disease carriers. According to a joke made by Ebenn Q3 Baobab, onetime doctor for a Neimoidian fleet, \"the principal export of the Neimoidian home planet is Brainworm Rot Type C\". Baobab further explained in his Galactic Phrase Book & Travel Guide that both the Great Pandemic of Deersheba and the Intestinal Revenge of Bars Barka (which emaciated scores of Ubese colonists) originated with the Neimoidians. At several times in the past, Neimoidia had been quarantined and forbidden to travelers.\n\n</p> <p>Upon death, Neimoidian bodies will desiccate rapidly if not immediately buried or burned. The corpse's face will elongate, and the brain sac will shrivel into a series of tiny pods behind the head. It is this terrifying image of death, coupled with the Geonosian physique, that inspired the appearance of the Trade Federation's B1 battle droids.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nNeimoidians spend their formative years as puny grubs in the communal hives of Neimoidia, until the age of seven standard years. They are knowingly neglected by being given limited amounts of food. In this way, the weaker individuals are weeded while the most acquisitive ones can hoard more food than they can eat by themselves. The Neimoidian education ensures the survival of the greediest. Because of that, the Neimoidians will retain ill memories of their homeworld and try to avoid it as much as possible. In fact, Neimoidia's most able individuals typically leave the planet at a young age, often joining the Trade Federation and its trading starships. Meanwhile, the weakest and least capable of the species are sequestered on Neimoidia and the purse-worlds, where they tend to vast insect hives, fungus farms, and beetle hatcheries.\n</p> <p>As adults, Neimoidians have a reputation of being skilled in matters of business and are well known for their leadership of the Trade Federation. Unfortunately, Neimoidians are stereotyped by other species as greedy, fearful of death, lazy, corrupt and even child neglecters.This is evident by the use of droids for almost everything. It is often said that one of the most difficult concepts for a Neimoidian to understand is loyalty.\n\n</p> <p>Members of other species often perceive the Neimoidians as villainous. In fact, the notions of morality and ethics that motivate other societies are completely absent from the Neimoidian culture. From infancy, they are reared to believe that anything they can appropriate is theirs by right, regardless of the means used.\n\n</p> <p>Their species is noted for being highly fearful to fight their own battles yet are deceitful to the point that they do not trust living soldiers. Such traits mean that they are often criticized for their cowardly nature and are one of the reasons why they make use of a mechanized army consisting of droids. This species is noted for being highly paranoid and in fact one of the most difficult concepts that they have understanding in Basic was the term loyalty. In addition, the discussion of an individual's feelings is considered an anaethema amongst Neimoidians.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nNeimoidia, also called Pure Neimoidia to avoid confusion with the Neimoidian purse worlds, is a planet in the Colonies region that the Duros from Duro colonized sometime around 25,000 BBY, bringing it into the Galactic Republic.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nPak Pak, also known as Neimoidian, is the main language spoken/conveyed by the Neimoidians. Pak Pak is both a verbal and nonverbal way of Neimoidian communication.</p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Nikto</h4> <p>\n\nThe Nikto are a reptilian humanoid species from the planet Kintan in the Si'Klaata Cluster with many subspecies.\n    </p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nNikto are reptilian humanoids that are noted for their leathery skin, with an average adult standing 1.8 meters tall. Sometimes they are covered in spikes and horns.\n</p> <p>The species hold a limited range of facial expressions because of a lack of the necessary muscular infrastructure. Most Nikto have coal-black obsidian eyes These are sometimes covered by a protective membrane that takes the form of a thin transparent pellicle that protects their eyes underwater and during windstorms. As a result, they are noted for their \"staring\" eyes and a seemingly blank expression which leads to many underestimating Nikto intelligence.\n\n</p> <p>The Nikto species features five distinct mutated sub-species due to the massive radiation from the dying nearby star M'dweshuu, which speeds up the rate of mutation so that traits that normally take millions of years to occur instead takes only thousands of years. The five sub-species inhabit different geographic areas of Kintan, developing unique adaptations to suit the different environments on the planet.\n    </p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nEarly in their development, tensions between the sub-species erupted into four bloody wars, although as their civilizations advanced, conquering the dangerous mutated flora and fauna of Kintan united them.\nNikto civilization gradually developed to a pre-star travel level, when they gained an understanding of M'dweshuu's influence on their species and their world. Numerous cults and secret societies developed in praise of M'dweshuu, offering sacrifice through bloodshed. The most prominent of these was the Cult of M'dweshuu, which rose and fell several times through its history. Another secret society was the Morgukai.\n\n</p> <p>A harsh life on Kintan combined with casual Hutt brutality made Nikto cunning combatants. Whilst lacking free will, they made up for this with their single-mindedness and tenacity. They were also able to quickly adapt to their environment.\n\nMost Nikto are content with a life of servitude as in their eyes a life in slavery was preferable to the hardship and toil on their homeworld. Not all Nikto work for the Hutts though most free members of their kind came from an enslaved species. Whilst Nikto are known to escape from their master, most tend to fall into service of another Hutt who \"inherit\" them according to custom should their previous employer die. However, some escaped Nikto do instead use some opportunities to genuinely become free beings. Any such emancipated Nikto has to be constantly on guard as they risked capture by Hutt-employed slavers who return their prey to their \"rightful owners\". In addition, they lack charisma and prefer to follow orders instead of giving them.\n\n</p> <p>Far-flung groups of Nikto rarely interbreed and has been the case ever since the species gained hyperdrive technology. Many taboos on racial divides were formed by the Nikto that was further supported by genetic diversity that was forced on them by their Hutt overlords.\n\n</p> <p>As the Hutts do not trust their servants, the Nikto have no real government of their own. Instead, an attache of the Hutt Clans of the Ancients rule them who speak for the Nikto on every political level. No planetary government is allowed on Kintan also due to the lingering presence of the Cult of M'dweeshu. However, individual Nikto are capable of becoming a clan chieftain. Despite this being the case, the Hutts speak for the Nikto in dealings with the rest of the galaxy.\n    </p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nKintan is the home world of the Nikto. After a supernova explosion near the system, evolution of the Nikto divided into five subspecies. Kintan is located within the Si'Klaata Cluster, on the Ac'fren Spur.\n</p> <p>Kintan striders, also found around the galaxy as pets of Hutts, are originally from Kintan. However, they were driven to extinction on the planet itself.\n    </p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nThe Nikto language is the native language of the Nikto species from Kintan.\n</p> <p>Contrarily to Klatooinians, Niktos do not forfeit their own language to replace it with Huttese, although most of them learn Huttese as a second language. Some Hutts learn to speak Nikto to deal with their Nikto servants.\n\n</p> <p>Most Nikto who leave their world are also fluent in Basic, although they are rarely literate in that language.</p>",

    "NOGHRI" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Noghri</h4> <p>\nThe only remaining sentients native to the planet Honoghr in the Outer Rim, the Noghri are a fierce, bipedal, humanoid species. Their physical stature and lack of social graces, including a sense of humor, has led many to dismiss them as primitive, and as such, they are often underestimated.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nThe Noghri have distinct physical features that allow them to be easily differentiated from the other denizens of the galaxy. They are hairless, gray or blue-skinned, and usually grow to be no more than 1.4 meters in height. Their faces are accentuated by a large sloping forehead that ends in a pronounced crest of bone just above their black eyes; this has the effect of causing their eyes to be deep-set. Though generally having the ability to completely cover their teeth with their lips, most Noghri have fangs that protrude from their mouths to some degree. Their clawed hands are another of their more prominent features.\n\n</p> <p>Perhaps one of the most significant characteristics they possess, the Noghri's sense of smell is unlike any other species in the galaxy. It is said that their sense of smell is so acute that they are even able to distinguish among the bloodlines of other sentient beings by scent alone.\n\n</p> <p>Due to the difficulties of life on Honoghr, their bodies have evolved to be lithe and muscular, which provides them not only great strength, but also quick reflexes. This combination of strength and reflexes has allowed the Noghri to become fearsome hunters and deadly warriors.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nNoghri society is clan based; each member is fiercely loyal to its clan and honor has a preeminent role in their culture. Each clan seems to be born out of the extended family and, as such, has a matriarch who leads the clan and maintains its history through written and oral tradition. Though there are numerous clans, the most notable are Clan Bakh'tor, Clan Baikh'vair, Clan Eikh'mir, Clan Khim'bar, Clan Hakh'khar, and Clan Tlakh'sar.\n\n</p> <p>Loyalty is also another significant aspect of Noghri culture. It is not uncommon for them to sacrifice themselves for their charge if they happen to be bodyguards or to willingly go to their deaths against the enemies of those who they have pledged their allegiance.\n</p> <p>As warriors and hunters, most Noghri on Honoghr still prefer hand-held weapons such as knives, spears and other \"primitive\" weapons due to the fact that they like being up-close-and-personal with their kills. Unlike those who remain on their home world, Noghri who travel throughout the galaxy have also adapted themselves to the use of all manner of warfare technologies from blasters to grenades; as often as not, though, they can still be seen engaging enemies in hand-to-hand combat, armed with either a knife, vibroblade, or merely their claws. Additionally, due to their natural ability of stealthiness, they make excellent assassins and special-forces troops.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nFor generations Noghri have been struggling to survive on the infertile surface of Honoghr, which was scarred and polluted by the poisonous fallout of a battle in orbit. During that conflict, a Lucrehulk-class Core ship, carrying the Trihexalophine1138 toxin on board, crashed into the planet's southern pole. The toxin killed most of the planet's flora, as well as millions of Noghri. To make matters worse, the surface was bombarded countless times by ordinary ship fire and the wildfires they sparked continued to burn off the poisoned plant life for months.\n</p> <p>As a direct result of these events Honoghr attained a green-brownish color when viewed from space -- reflecting its dead terrain. In the southern hemisphere there remains a green region known as the \"clean land\". It became a home for the surviving Noghri following the catastrophe as they settled along the region's borders and cultivated its interior. Before the ecological disaster the Clean Land had been a neutral location for the various Noghri clans where they could discuss matters without worrying about inter-clan rivalries.\n\n</p> <p>In the subsequent decades, natural processes and the efforts of the natives have worked to restore much of the Honoghr's surface. The gradual regrowth has resulted in juvenile forests, swamps and jungles appearing in areas which were once completely inhospitable. The majority of these have taken root near the large ocean which crosses the equator while the planet's capital, open to foreign visitors, lies in its cold and arid north.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nThe languages spoken most frequently by Noghri are their native tongue, Honoghran (sometimes called Noghrese) and Basic. Noghri who speak Basic almost always speak in soft, whispered, chilling voices.</p>",

    "ORTOLAN" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Ortolan</h4> <p>\nThe Ortolans, elephantine bipeds, have a distinctive appearance, reinforced by their habit of dying their short, thick velvet fur that is generally white or grey into various bright colours. The color of the fur denotes the Ortolan's role in society: orange is a political career, green is a military career, red is a domestic job such as a doctor or a keeper of the peace, and blue is an entertainer, such as a musician or an actor.  They are short in stature with big black eyes, a characteristic descended from their nocturnal ancestors that allows them to see well in dim light but can hinder or potentially even hurt them in bright light.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nKnown for their excellent sense of smell, Ortolans can detect food from great distances. Because food is scarce on their planet they are obsessed with it, which has led them to become renowned chefs and food connoisseurs. They use their fingertips to absorb their food, and also to use various fingered instruments to produce the fine tunes for which Ortolan musicians have become famous. This attribute is complemented by their trunk-like noses, which contain a tympanic organ that also contributes to their hearing.\n\n\n</p> <p>Their outstanding hearing aids them in their musical endeavours, covering the entire sound range from subsonic to ultrasonic. To outside observers Ortolans may seem mute, but they communicate in the aforementioned extreme ranges of sound frequencies, using their noses and the small mouth located underneath. However, they are also able to communicate in the normal auditory range that can be heard by the majority of sentients.\n\n\n</p> <p>Ortolans have adapted to the harsh conditions of their homeworld, Orto, with a layer of blubber beneath the surface of their skin, which insulates them against the ice-cold temperatures. This provides energy reserves in time of need and also results in their obese build.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nThe tradition of dying their fur began when a Devaronian trader tried to sell Ortolans a shipment of food dyes—they considered dyeing their food a waste of time, but found dyed fur to be quite stylish. \n</p> <p>Education is the responsibility of their parents, though gifted youngsters would often be traded to other families to get specialized education. At the age of seven, Ortolans are expected to support themselves, and will be forced out of the family unit unless they had a particularly valuable talent. \n</p> <p>Ortolan society is reasonably industrialized, though not as technologically advanced as other species. Despite this, their economy is mostly based on barter, with credits primarily used to trade with offworlders. \nCommon names among the Ortolans include: Bedo, Eembek, Miebar, Nabkess, Ooben, Ruznee. \n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nOrto is a desolate planet, found uncomfortable by most humanoids. A majority of the planet is covered in tundra, with a cluster of forests along the equator. It was originally discovered several years after the Great Sith War, though none of the humans on the survey ship attempted to explore in the subzero temperatures. It took a group of Talz adventurers to explore the planet during the Third Galactic Survey, towards the end of the reign of the Old Republic.\n</p> <p>The Talz mentioned the planet was unremarkable on the surface, though complex clusters of natives could be found. Deep holes were dug near the equator, and small villages of Ortolans resided on the bottom of these deep holes. The Ortolans are large, pudgy creatures with long trunks, and come in a variety of shades, similar to Twi`leks. Many of Ortolans left their planet with the Talz expedition, a majority of them being entertainers. Quickly establishing themselves, Ortolan entertainers became known as the best of the best\n\n</p> <p>Orto is rarely visited by others, and is known to be a peaceful home to the Ortolan species. It is generally considered to be of little importance on a galactic scale, and the Ortolans are confident that by spreading their music and entertainment, they are making the galaxy a more aesthetic place that hopefully will not cast its eye on their homeplanet.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nOrtolan is the native language of the Ortolan species from planet Orto. Most Ortolans are fluent in both Ortolan language and Basic, although they are only literate in their own language.\n</p> <p>Ortolan language is formed of grunts and hoots. Its words are formed of one hard syllable followed by a soft syllable for declension.</p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Pau'an</h4> <p>\nPau'ans are gaunt near-Humans native to the planet Utapau. Also known as Utapauns and Ancients due to their long lifespans, they co-exist on Utapau with the Utai. The two species get along well, with the lanky Pau'ans assuming leadership roles on the planet. Though some view the Pau'ans as frightening, they are friendly, and are more than happy to welcome visitors to their little-known world. Due to Utapau's remoteness in the Outer Rim Territories, the Pau'ans were isolated for most of their history. However, they played a part in galactic events in 19 BBY, when the Confederacy of Independent Systems conquered Utapau. The Pau'ans opposed the Confederacy with the aid of the Republic, and later opposed the Empire, after Imperials took control of their planet following the Declaration of a New Order.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nThe average member of the sentient near-Human Pau'an, or Utapaun, as they are sometime called, species stand taller than a Human, at approximately 1.9 meters. They are bald and their head is striped with furrowed gray skin. Pau'ans weigh seventy kilograms on average. Pau'ans have large, sunken black eyes in red eye sockets and jagged, fang-like teeth used for tearing into raw meat, as they are carnivores. The species has pale, wrinkled skin, due to the fact that they live in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. These traits cause some to view them as frightening. However, Pau'ans as a society are generally friendly, and are happy to welcome guests to their often overlooked world. Pau'ans have long lifespans, living up to 700 years, much longer than the Utai, the other species native to Utapau. This earned them the nickname of \"Ancients\". Members of the species are able to see well in darkness. Pau'ans have four fingers and toes, but are more mobile than they appeared. They often wear elaborate clothes intended to heighten their impressive stature.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nThe Pau'ans fulfill most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the Utai do not desire such work, serving as laborers instead. Most Pau'ans serve as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gives them experience that would be used later in their life. Pau'ans are kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Each city on Utapau is controlled by a Master of Port Administration, a hereditary title reserved for Pau'ans. These administrators are assisted by advisory councils for making important decisions about their city, turning to the Utapauan Security Force when necessary. Each Administrator serves on the Utapauan Committee and oversees planetary governance. However the committee rarely makes crucial decisions, as the cities are able to function on their own most of the time.\n\n</p> <p>Despite the many differences between the Pau'ans and the Utai, the two species are able to co-exist peacefully, although inhabitants of the different Utapaun cities often have conflicts due to philosophical differences. Still, these conflicts rarely develop into bloodshed, and it is more common for the cities to ignore each other. Each city has its own culture, and competition is fierce between the groups. However, they are able to cooperate when the situation necessitated it, such as during the Confederate invasion of the planet in 19 BBY.\n\n</p> <p>Pau'an society is a blend of a variety of styles and cultures, borne from the ancient merger with the Utai. Built into the sinkhole walls, Pau'an settlements such as the Pau City spaceport are divided into different areas, each a mix of architectural styles and other-worldly design. They like art, and enjoy studying sculptures and finding ways to incorporate different artistic styles into their architecture. Pau'ans developed an industrial society, despite their seemingly primitive and natural image, though the Utai were the ones who actually did the hard work. The Utai did not mind, however, and collectively much preferred labor to positions of leadership. They are able to power their city by wind, harnessing it through massive windmills. Over ninety-nine percent of the planet's power comes from these windmills. Most Pau'ans ride living beasts like varactyls and dactillions instead of speeders. Pau'ans, as well as Utai, are known for their love for podracing.\n\n</p> <p>Pau'ans represented 30%—or approximately 28.5 million—of Utapau's total population of 90 million inhabitants.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nUtapau is an arid sinkhole world in the Utapau system of the Tarabba sector in the Outer Rim Territories. Utapau is the homeworld of the Pau'ans and the Utai, more commonly referred to collectively as Utapauns. These species live in the many giant sinkholes that dotted the planet's scrub-covered surface.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nUtapese is the language of the Pau'ans on the planet Utapau. Most Pau'ans speak and are literate in both Utapese and Basic. The language once had several different dialects.</p>",

    "QUARREN" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Quarren</h4> <p>\nThe Quarren are a humanoid race native to Calamari's deep oceans. They have helmet-shaped heads that are composed of a mass of tentacles set below close-set eyes. They are more accustomed to deep-sea living, and chose to live below the water. Their conservative and solitary nature has led them to be unwilling to trust new ideas or lofty concepts.\n</p> <p>When they first came in contact with the shore-dwelling Mon Calamari, the Quarren were hesitant. They eventually began to cooperate with the Mon Cal, and together they developed a symbiotic relationship in which the Quarren provide the raw materials, and the Mon Cal provide the knowledge and expertise; this led to the construction of the huge floating cities that dominate Calamari's oceans. Because of their pragmatic nature, the Quarren did not want to travel and explore the stars, as the Mon Cal did, and this began to create friction between the two races. When the Mon Cal's dream of contact with other stars became the deadly war with the Empire, the Quarren chose to ignore it, leaving the battle to the Mon Calamari who brought it upon themselves.\n</p> <p>However, the Quarren could not escape the Empire, and it is rumoured that a Quarren helped the Empire evade the Calamarian defences and overtake the planet. Unfortunately, the Quarren were enslaved along with the Mon Cal. When the Mon Cal resisted Imperial rule, the Empire began destroying the floating cities. This served to unite the two races temporarily, and together they were able to solidify their defences and drive off the Empire with nothing more than crude weapons. After that, there were a number of Quarren who left the planet, seeking a life among the stars as their neighbours the Mon Cal did.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nQuarren are aquatic humanoids with squid-like heads, at least four tentacles on their faces, and leathery skin. Quarren tentacles are prehensile, and they are able to manipulate food with them. Quarren have small mouths, with two fang-like teeth jutting from their faces on either side, and a long, thin tongue sticking out in between. Quarren have two long protrusions that extend from either side of their faces. In these protrusions are several gill-like structures that are actually aural structures, used for hearing instead of ears. Quarren also have holes on either sides of their neck that are most likely used for breathing. Quarren have two sac-like organs that hang from the back of their heads as well. \n</p> <p>Most Quarren have orange skin, although some Quarren have gray-green skin - this trait, however, is extremely rare. Pink or purple-skinned Quarren exist, though presumably in small numbers. All Quarren also have two shimmering blue eyes. Being aquatic in nature, Quarren have to keep their skin moist in order to stay alive, although clawed Quarren seemed to need less moisture than other Quarren.\n</p> <p>There are three different types of Quarren, although the only difference lay in their hands. Some Quarren have suction-tipped fingers, either with three or five fingers. Other Quarren have thick fingers that lack suction cups on the tips of their fingers, yet have sharp claws instead. Whether these three groups are actually distinct subspecies is unknown. \n</p> <p>Having evolved in the depths of Mon Calamari, Quarren can descend to depths of 300 meters without any breathing or pressure apparatus. However, when descending to 50 meters or deeper, they have to spend as much time decompressing as they spent under 50 meters of water to allow their bodies to readjust to the lower surface pressure.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nQuarren are a very self-centered and proud species, almost to the point of being xenophobic, which coincides with their isolationist behavior. Quarren find Humans to be very crude beings and think their language (Galactic Basic) to be very cumbersome, and unsuitable for speech. The Quarren instead speak their native language more frequently, in contrast to the Mon Calamari who speak Basic far more often, in order to deal with off-worlders, which the Quarren seldom did.\n</p> <p>In sharp contrast to the Mon Calamari, the Quarren are far more conservative and practical in their thinking. While the Mon Calamari look towards the future, the Quarren remember yesterdays. Also, while the Mon Calamari often travel throughout the galaxy, the Quarren are far more isolationist, staying, for the most part, in the depths of the oceans of their homeworld. However, some Quarren follow suit after the Mon Calamari, and make their living in the galaxy as business managers and accountants.\n</p> <p>While the Mon Calamari manufacture starships in orbital shipyards, the Quarren diligently mine metal ore for their brethren from the deepest parts of the ocean. The Quarren also help build massive floating cities for the Mon Calamari. While most Mon Calamari live on the few scattered islands on Dac, or on the upper levels of their floating cities, the Quarren live in their own cities, deep beneath the waves, or in the lower levels of the cities, for the cities stretch far below the surface, and the Quarren love the dark far more than the Mon Calamari.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nDac, as it is called in Mon Calamarian, Quarrenese, and Basic, also known as Mon Calamari and sometimes simply called Calamari or Mon Cala, is a planet in the Calamari system of the Calamari sector, located in the Outer Rim. It is home to a wealth of sentient species: the Mon Calamari, the Quarren, the Moappa, the Amphi-Hydrus, and the Whaladons. Mon Calamari is the name given to the planet by Human explorers from the Galactic Republic who first discovered and revealed the world to the rest of the galaxy. The native species refer to the planet as Dac. The planet is a shining bluish-white orb from space, due to its ocean-covered surface. It is home to 27.5 billion Mon Calamarians and Quarren, as well as surrounded by the impressive Mon Calamari Shipyards.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nQuarren, also refererred to as Quarrenese, is the official language of the Quarren species.\n</p> <p>Quarrens are mostly bilingual in both Quarrenese and Basic, although many of them also learn Mon Calamarian. Converesly, many Mon Calamari learn Mon Calamarian, Basic and Quarrenese. Quarrenese is also extended in planets with notable colonies of Quarrens.</p>",

In some sectors it is legal to enslave or hunt Ryn. Their language is outlawed in many locations, and a large number of Ryn women are used as slave breeding stock.\n\n</p> <p>The largest concentration of Ryn is located in the Corporate Sector due to the fact that it is far from those who would persecute them.

An amphibious species, they are excellent swimmers and have the ability to hold their breath for very long periods of time when under water. Though they resemble anthropomorphic catfish and have aqua-coloured skin, they do not have gills. All members of the Selkath race have venom-tipped, retractable claws. Similar to the Wookiees, the use of these claws in any form of combat is considered dishonourable and a sign of madness.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nAs an aquatic species, the Selkath are skilled swimmers. They resemble anthropomorphic sting rays and have blue-,pink- or green-colored skin, which is patterned for underwater camouflage, and their mouths are bracketed by cephalic lobes. They tend to stroke these during conversation, analogous to the Human habit of stroking facial hair, such as mustaches.\n</p> <p>All members of the Selkath race have retractable, venom-tipped claws. Similar to the Wookiees, the use of these claws in any form of combat or attack is considered dishonorable and a sign of madness; to do this is to give in to animal instincts unbecoming of a sentient species. The females Selkath differ from males by the presence of a number of tendrils at the back of their heads.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nWith the formation of the Republic, the Selkath did not join, but adopted a policy of strict neutrality. Many millennia later, their planet was allowed to keep this neutrality intact due to the advantageous position granted to them by their monopoly on the supply of kolto. Kolto, produced solely on Manaan, is a liquid that contains unique healing properties. When the liquid is applied to wounds it increases the healing rate, and patients can even be immersed in it in special tanks for greater effect. During conflicts, the Selkath threaten to cut off the supply of kolto, unless both sides respect their neutrality.\n\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nManaan is an aquatic planet in the Pyrshak system. It is home to the Selkath, an amphibious species. The planet is completely covered in water and is the only known source of the healing liquid, kolto, in the galaxy. Controlled by the Rakata during pre-Republic history, it became independent following the collapse of their Infinite Empire. In the years leading up to and during the Jedi Civil War, kolto was so important to the galaxy that the Selkath were able to use their monopoly to enforce their policy of neutrality and autonomy. \n</p> <p>The only above-surface settlement on Manaan is the floating Ahto City. During the Jedi Civil War, both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic attempted to get an upper hand in the war by creating secret deals that would give them more kolto. Ultimately, however, the Selkath banned the Sith from Manaan for trying to overthrow the government.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nSelkath is the language of the Selkath.</p>",

This is evident by the species colonizing all the unpopulated worlds in the Uvena system to prevent them from being settled by non-Shistavanen settlers, their restrictive trade laws (which were unapologetic in how they favored their own kind over off-world traders), and from the fact that they do not mix with non-Shistavanens much. Most of their society uses technology similar to the rest of the galaxy, though some parts of Uvena Prime use slightly less sophisticated technology.\n</p> <p>A minority of Shistavanens are more outgoing, and travel the galaxy's hyperlanes. Even these Shistavanens usually remain by themselves or with other Shistavanens. Due to their natural predatory instincts, keen sense of hearing, excellent eyesight and sharp sense of smell, Shistavanens find common employment as scouts, mercenaries and bounty hunters.

While their bodies above the waist are humanoid, their lower halves are serpentine, long and heavily muscled. Sluissi are noted for their calm temperament, aversion to rushing and impatience, compliance to protocol, no matter how trivial, and their technical aptitude. Like most reptiles, Sluissi can use their forked tongues to sense heat.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nSluissi's upper torsos are similar to a human's, with two arms, each with four-fingered hands. Their fourth finger is an opposable digit. Their arms have almost winglike extensions of skin, which aid their movement while they aree flat on the ground. The bottom half of their body is similar to a snake's, with a long, heavily muscled, singular tail. Their bodies are covered in fine scales which range in color from light brown to dark green. Other colored scales on Sluissi are not unheard of, however they are quite rare. Sluissi have round black eyes and a swooping, hoodlike fold of tough skin at the back of their heads. They have forked tongues that aid their sense of smell. The average member of the species weighs 60 kilograms.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nSluissi are patient, sociable, relaxed, easy-going beings, famous for remaining calm under pressure. Their patient, calm nature—combined with their seeming inability to have become genuinely upset or angry—often baffles, and sometimes even infuriates other species. Extremely industrious, Sluissi love to tinker with technology and mechanical objects, and Sluissi technicians are able to improve the engine efficiency, power output and system response in even archaic, worn out ships.\n</p> <p>The Sluissi are extremely methodical, and work extremely slowly at their work. To them, starship construction is an art form. Although jobs done by Sluissi always take longer than expected, most clients are willing to be patient, because Sluissi technicians can make improvements upon or salvage vessels when no other mechanics can. Even the Empire realizes that rushing a Sluissi operation is a bad idea.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nSluis Van is the primary planet in the Sluis sector of the Outer Rim Territories and the homeworld of the Sluissi race.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nSluissese is the native language of the Sluissi species from Sluis Van. Most Sluissi are fluent in both Sluissese and Basic, being literate in both languages. However, when speaking Basic, Sluissi tend to lisp and slur many words because of their snakelike mouths and viperine tongue.</p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Snivvian</h4> <p>\nSnivvians are a mammalian humanoid species native to the world of Cadomai Prime. They are sometimes called Snaggletooths due to their protruding jaws and short fangs. Because they come from a planet with a cold environment, evolution gave them thick skin instead of fur. Due to their oversized snouts, Snivvians make excellent scouts and trackers. Most Snivvians choose to speak Basic as well as a diverse range of secondary languages. Some refuse to let go of their native tongue for symbolic, subtextual, or fashionable reasons.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nTheir physiology is indicative of their environment, although it is somewhat unusual. The harsh, frigid conditions on Cadomai have given them thick skin instead of heavy fur. This skin is formed of special membranes that open and close pores to regulate heat loss, in response to temperature differences. Snivvians don't sweat, since their skin doesn't exude moisture. They also don't suffer from frostbite.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nSnivvians are among the most renowned artists and authors in the galaxy. Their homeworld of Cadomai Prime has extremely cold temperatures and long winters, forcing the Snivvians to live long periods of time in subterranean caverns. During those long days, Snivvians develop their artistic talents and sensibilities. They produce masterpieces in holography, painting, sculpture, music, and the written word. Although technology would eventually lessen the need for this form of hibernation, Snivvians still feel the need—biologically and culturally—to continue the tradition. Many Snivvians travel throughout the galaxy in attempt to live the lives of the subjects of their future artistic works, even when it was dangerous.\n</p> <p>Snivvians have a reputation for sociopathic tendencies similar to the Trandoshans, and they try to control their genetics in order to curtail such tendencies. When twin males are born, one of them will invariably display traits of psychotic genius.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nCadomai Prime, also known as simply Cadomai, is a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories' Catarlo sector, along the northern end of the major hyperlane known as the Hydian Way. A frigid world with intolerably cold winters, Cadomai's tundra plains are home to the Snivvian species, who are renowned for their art. Cadomai also holds a large system of subterranean caverns, where the Snivvians make their homes during the subfreezing winters. Cadomai Prime possesses a single moon, and is part of the Cadomai system. \n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nSnivvian is the native language of the Snivvian species from Cadomai Prime. Most Snivvians are fluent in both Snivvian and Basic, although they are only literate in their own language, and they have a nasal accent when speaking Basic. Snivvians are fascinated by galactic culture, and thus are happy to speak Basic with non-Snivvians. However, there are some Snivvians who refuse to use Basic because of their personal philosophy. In any case, all Snivvians are delighted to encounter members of other species trying to communicate in Snivvian.</p>",

    "SQUIB" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Squib</h4> <p>\nSquibs are a sentient species from Skor II known for collecting, trading, and haggling. Adult Squibs have humanoid bodies that average a meter in height. They are covered in colorful fur and have pointed snouts, tufted ears, and large eyes. Squibs taste objects by rubbing them over their fur. They are gregarious, insatiably curious, and obsessed with haggling and deal-making. It is said that the easiest way to get information from a Squib is to propose a trade.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nSquibs are small, sentient, humanoid mammals with both rodent and canine characteristics. They range from 0.8 to 1.2 meters in height[11] and weigh twenty-two kilograms on average. Their pink skin is covered in fur that range from white, gray, black, and brown to blue, violet, and red. The coat offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serve as an olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance and ascertain intrinsic details—such as penetrating through a disguise or identifying a forgery—when rubbed against. The species has both male and female sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty determining the sex of a Squib based on his or her appearance alone.\n</p> <p>Squib eyes are large in relation to the skull and located on the sides of the head. They come in shades of blue, yellow, red, and brown. Their large ears often sport tufts of fur whose color can differ from that of the main coat; the ears point upward and can pivot to zero in on specific sounds. The short Squib muzzle tapersd to a bewhiskered black nose. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white teeth, and their flexible cheeks are capable of storing items. The species has nimble, five-fingered hands and five toes on each foot. Non-Squibs often consider the small beings humorous or cute in appearance.\n</p> <p>The Squibs have quick metabolisms and relatively short life spans. A Squib is considered a child—referred to as a fuzzling—until nine standard years of age. As he or she matures, the fur changes color, a phenomenon that causes a dappled appearance on the back; similarly, the eyes and ears grow more quickly than the rest of the body, causing the latter to flop until the rest of the fuzzling's body grows enough to catch up. Sexual maturity occurs at thirteen standard years. Beginning at around thirty-nine years, a Squib enters middle age, when the fur grays and the face wrinkles. Squib life expectancy is about sixty-five standard years.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nSquibs are cheerful, gregarious, and overconfident to the point of egotism. Their biology leads to a common Squib greeting: rubbing a person's palm across the cheek fur. As Squibs often wear gloves, the gesture conveys more information than a simple handshake. They are friendly and non-threatening, making them quite likable—at first. Over time, Squib acquaintances can grow to regard the beings as slightly annoying to downright obnoxious Furbag and furball are derisive terms for Squibs.\n</p> <p>Squibs are inherently curious. They handle anything that interested them, usually by rubbing it against their fur with little forethought as to whether doing so might be harmful. Squib curiosity and propensity for haggling make them unabashed pack rats. Although the species has no need for clothing to protect themselves from the elements, they wear clothes and footwear for reasons of appearance and extra storage; typical clothing includes pockets and pouches to stuff with odds and ends that catch their eye, since a Squib can never tell when a particular item might be useful in making a deal. Still, individuals leave fur exposed to facilitate olfaction. Their accumulative drives earn the species a reputation as thieves among some members of the galactic community.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nSkor II is a planet in the Squab system and the homeworld of the Squibs. It is located in the Outer Rim Territories just west of the Rimma Trade Route. The world is small, with a varied terrain and climate that provide it with vast natural resources. The planet's system of government, known as the polyanarchy, is headed by a king. One major population center is Metrobig City, site of the Metrobig Interplanetary Blastport.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nSquibbian is the native language of the Squib species from Skor II.\n</p> <p>Most Squibs know both Squibbian and Basic, although they are only literate in their own language. However, they only manage to get a limited grasp on Basic. As a result, a Squib seems inarticulate when speaking Basic. Their sentences in Squib have surface and deeper meanings, and at least one of these (usually the surface meaning) is lost when translated to Basic, except for another Squib.</p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Sullustan</h4> <p>\nSullustans are a species of Near-Humans from Sullust. As skilled pilots and navigators, Sullustans, also known as Bomewrights, are common sights for spacers and at busy spaceports.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nA diminutive species of near-Humans, Sullustans range from 1 to 1.8 meters in height and bear round, tapered skulls. Sullustans are distinguishable for their almond-shaped black eyes, facial jowls called dewflaps and large, round ears.\n</p> <p>Having evolved in the underground of their planet, their wide earlobes provide excellent hearing and sense of directional sound, and their large eyes provide exceptional low-light vision and excellent peripheral vision. Sullustans can see up to 20 meters in the dark without being sensitive to infra-red, meaning they can effectively read and see normally with no light at all. Perhaps due to their relative lack of exposure to natural light, Sullustans begin to suffer from corneal defects after 30 standard years. After significant deterioration, many chose to wear special visors to prevent further damage. Some Sullustans tattoo their heads as a form of individual expression.\n</p> <p>Like humans, Sullustans have only a single heart and one stomach. It is very difficult to get a Sullustan drunk, and Sullustans who do get drunk do not suffer hangovers.\n</p> <p>Sullustans are pink-skinned and generally hairless, although facial hair is known to occur in some cases in males. Cranial hair is rare for males, but females of the species often grow it; it is considered a symbol of individuality and is worn in a manner helping to express this.\n</p> <p>Sullustans possess exceptional innate sense of direction and intuition since their civilization developed in underground tunnels; many are able to navigate a path after seeing a map only once. This ability extends to sublight and hyperspace navigation, as well as patrol work, so much so that Sullustans make excellent scouts, pilots and navigators.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nSullustans are outgoing and mercantile, friendly and pragmatic. As a species they are altogether lacking in xenophobia. Though fond of practical jokes and extremely shrewd in their business dealings, they are eager to explore and travel the galaxy. Inquisitive by nature, some have described Sullustans as reckless, especially for their preference to learn and discover whenever possible through personal experience.\nSullustans organize themselves into familial units known as Warren-clans. Each clan consists of one polyandrous female, several husbands and their young. Unmated females, known as \"Fems\", are active members of their communities until they reach the status of \"Ready\" which marks their breeding years. At the outset of Ready, \"Fems\" choose their mates and found their own Warren-clans.\n</p> <p>Few Sullustans leave their homeworld, but those that do often find employment as pilots or merchants. Inspired by legends like Mayjeln, Sullustan spacers put their skills as navigators to use and are prized crewers across the galaxy. Because of this, their flowing, staccato language of Sullustese is known to many smugglers. Sullustan names are often direct translations from Sullustese words and typically consist of a given name and surname of four letters each.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nSullust is the primary planet of the Sullust system, located in the Outer Rim at the conjuncture of the Rimma Trade Route and the Silvestri Trace.

The only obvious feature of their furry faces is their four black eyes, but it also holds a proboscis through which they speak their buzzing native language and feed. </p> <p>They are gently, kind-hearted beings who are slow to anger.\nThe four eyes of the Talz are perhaps his or her most remarkable feature. One pair is adapted to see clearly in light so blinding that it might burn the corneas of most other beings, while the other pair can see in near total darkness. The end result is that Talz can see in virtually any lighting conditions and are not blinded by bright flashes.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nMost Talz are unaware that a vast galactic civilization exists beyond their world. Imperial scouts discovered them as the New Order was putting a final end to the Republic. The Empire recognized that they had discovered a ready-made slave labor force to extract the mineral wealth of Alzoc III. But all the Talz know is that one day, rocks fell from the sky, and out of these rocks stepped strange beings who forced them to give up their normal routines to make caves. The Talz live in the hope that the strange beings will leave someday so that life can return to normal.\n</p> <p>Due to the timing of the world's discovery, the New Order did not log the existence of the Talz, not wanting to be burdened by the Senate regulations relating to the treatment and handling of primitive sentients. Even after the Empire was firmly entrenched, they kept the mines on Alzoc III and the enslaved Talz a secret. As such, the Talz are very rarely encountered anywhere but Alzoc III, and those who do show up elsewhere tend to be in the service of Imperial officials. A few Talz have fled their homeworld and escaped Imperial custody through a variety of means, but those who stray too far from loosely controlled systems on the far fringes of the Outer Rim tend to be captured and sent back to their homeworld.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nAlzoc III is the only truly habitable world in the Alzoc system, and yet thanks to its axial inclination of 23 degrees, it is largely covered with frozen plains, broken up only by the occasional volcanoes and icy seas. Alzoc III’s sidereal orbital period is over five hundred and twenty two days long, with a day last nearly seventy three hours. The temperate rarely rises above five degrees Celsius, though at the equator it can sometimes rise as high as twenty Celsius, though the weather is surprisingly calm for a world of its type. The atmosphere is comprised of fairly typical gases, most notably nitrogen and oxygen, though there has been a gradual build up of carbon dioxide due to the industrial pollution created by the Empire’s unrestricted mining enterprises on the planet.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nTalz or Talzzi is the native language of the Talz species from Alzoc III. It is mainly formed by buzzes and chirps, with variable pitch being an essential feature.\n\n</p> <p>The Talz throat and proboscis structure make them unable to speak most languages of the galaxy except for their own. Most Talz are not fluent in Basic and have no understanding of it. As Talz language is not very well-known outside Alzoc III, protocol droids are usually not fluent in that language, although they could easily be programmed to translate it.</p>",

Female Togorians are up to 2.2 meters tall, while adult males ranged up to 3.0 meters. They are covered in gray-white to black fur, often with more colorful spots or stripes. They have extremely dense bone tissue, allowing them to endure greater physical trauma than beings with similar physiques.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nTogorians evolved as nomadic hunters of creatures like the bist and etelo. In turn, flying reptiles called liphons preyed upon the Togorians. Primitive Togorians noticed that slightly smaller flying reptiles, mosgoths, were also targeted by liphons who attacked their nests and stole their eggs. Togorians began camping near the mosgoths for mutual protection, eventually domesticating them as mounts. Soon, a rift in their society developed—while males wanted to continue their lifestyle as nomads, females wanted the comfort and safety of permanent camps. In other species, the conflict would have led to one lifestyle winning over the other, but both male and female Togorians are too stubborn.\n</p> <p>Eventually, the males continued their nomadic ways, riding their mosgoths and hunting, and competing in contests of prowess. Meanwhile, the females stayed in villages with pre-pubescent children, with those communes eventually growing into cities. While the males continued to hunt in the wilderness, the females tended domesticated herds and developed technology. Males would visit their mates for about a month each year, but the sexes lived completely separate lives otherwise. Whether in spite of the separation of the sexes, or because of it, Togorians are monogamous, and devoted to their chosen mates.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nTogoria is a planet in the Mid Rim and the homeworld of the Togorians.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nTogorian is the native language of the Togorian species from Togoria. It is a harsh-sounding language.\nMost Togorians are fluent in both Togorian language and Basic, although they are only literate in their own language.\n</p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Togruta</h4> <p>\nThe Togruta are a carnivorous humanoid species from the planet Shili. The species exhibits head-tails which are similar to those of Twi'leks. Togruta are also distinguished by montrals, large hollow horn-like projections from the top of their heads, that give the species a form of passive echolocation. In order to protect themselves from dangerous predators, and to hunt their own prey, Togruta band together in tribes and rely on their natural pigmentation to disrupt and confuse slow-witted beasts. Togruta work well in large groups, and individualism is seen as abnormal within their culture, although it is also a necessary quality in leaders.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nTogruta have rusty skin tones ranging in hue from orange to red, with white pigmentation on their faces, and greyish lips. While not all have this feature, white stripes also adorned various parts of their bodies, including their chests, legs, backs, arms, lekku (head-tails), and montrals. The pattern of stripes vary from individual to individual. This red and white pattern is a phenotype left over from their ancestor's camouflage that helped them to blend in with their natural surroundings, especially the red-and-white turu-grass which dominated Shili's scrublands.\n</p> <p>Their heads bear two montrals, with three, and on rare occasions, four head-tails, whose stripes are darker than those of the montrals. Togruta have the ability to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect space ultrasonically. Young Togrutas' montrals and posterior head-tail do not fully grow until adolescence, when their montrals become curved and their third head-tail grew to the length of their two main head-tails.\n</p> <p>As predators, Togruta have sharp canine teeth, which they use to painlessly kill thimiars, their primary prey, causing the creatures' post-mortem death spasms. This gives outsiders the false impression that Togruta are venomous. However, Togrutas do nothing to dispel this misconception and even take advantage of the intimidating presence it gives them.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nTogruta have a strong sense of unity and togetherness. On their native homeworld of Shili, they rely on each other and will band together to take a stand against the massive monsters that hunt them, such as the akul. It is said that the creatures of Shili most often attack in groups, which is even more reason for the native Togruta to work together.\n</p> <p>While most of Shili is covered in the scrublands where the Togruta hunt their herbivorous prey, the Togruta live in small communities in the forest valleys, where the canopies keep them out of sight.\n</p> <p>Togruta are known for their habit of not wearing shoes; they believe that the land is spiritually connected to them, and wearing shoes cut themselves from a bond with the land. In the pack, every able Togruta is expected to contribute his or her own share, as any food attained is distributed equally. Togruta are also known for their belief that those who cannot keep up should be left to fend for themselves, because that is nature's way. Other sentient species find this particular belief quite barbaric. Those within a pack who lead have a difficult time with fulfilling their goals because of the risk of becoming individualistic. As hunters, the Togruta show off the pelts and teeth of their game as a sign of pride and maturation. Special pride is taken in the teeth of akul that a Togruta has taken down as an individual. These teeth often are made into jewelry such as an akul-tooth headdress or a necklace, which also incorporates metals, stones, and pearls found on Shili.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nShili was the homeworld of the Togrutas located in the Ehosiq sector.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nTogruti is the native language of the Togruta from planet Shili. Most Togruta are fluent and literate in both Togruti and Basic.\n</p> <p>Togruti is an ornate language using trills and long vowel sounds, which are modified by subtle tremors in the Togruta's head-tails.\n</p> <p>This language is heavily influenced by Basic, but also incorporates some native idioms, which cause Basic-speaking Togruta to use strange expressions.\n</p>",

Strong-willed, and resistant to manipulation of the mind through the Force, this species produces a body odor similar to sweetspice. With a reputation for being stingy and bad-tempered, many Toydarians are possessed of a strong sense of pride in their work.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nA mammalian race of winged, stout bodied humanoids, the Toydarians have stubby facial tusks which protrude from their lower jaw and frame a short pudgy trunk. Typically a Toydarian has blue-green skin, except over their stomachs which are cream-colored, and each hand and their webbed feet have three digits each. While their stubby legs can support their body weight, Toydarians' primary mode of locomotion is their use of the wings on their upper back. Despite the frailty of their wings and the apparent heaviness of their large gut, Toydarians are remarkably buoyant. Indeed, Toydarian bodily tissue is extremely absorbent of natural gases in the air, which make them incredibly light weight. Though their wings can beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burns up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. </p> <p>In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians will eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies.\nSimilar to the Hutts, Toydarian brains have an unusual composition which make them immune to influence from the Force. The males of the species usually show sparse whiskers, though their craniums remain bare of any hair. Toydarian newborns emerge from their mothers' wombs fully developed, and are able to fly from birth. This characteristic is a vital survival adaption; land-bound creatures fall prey to the dangerous grabworms that roamed the planet's marshes.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nDespite being ruled by the Hutts, the Toydarian people are able to govern themselves free of major outside intervention through the establishment of a feudal monarchy. A ruling king sits on the planet's throne, allowing vassals to form allegiances and have minor disputes to solve their own problems. The king makes sure to keep his vassals happy and to have their allegiance, but will occasionally encourage infighting to reveal the true character of the vassals and weed out treachery.\n</p> <p>A common trait of all Toydarians is their shrewd business sense and their ability to haggle any deal. A loyal and proud people, these traits can be off-putting to outsiders, as many Toydarians in the galaxy are seen as crooks or slimy businessmen, but this is not always the case.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nToydaria is a large, muddy planet located in the Toydaria system of Hutt Space, and home to the mind trick-resistant Toydarians.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nToydarian language is the native language of the Toydarian species from Toydaria.\n</p> <p>Most Toydarians are fluent in both Toydarian language and Basic, although they are only literate in their own language. However, they would rather converse in Toydarian. Many Toydarians are fluent in Huttese instead of Basic, as the species has a long commercial history with the Hutts.\n</p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Ubese</h4> <p>\nTo most inhabitants of the galaxy, members of the enigmatic Ubese, or Ubesian, species are generally known as mysterious wanderers and nomadic savages. Their xenophobic nature makes them ideally suited for professions such as mercenaries or bounty hunters. Normally, they are a very aggressive people, though loyal to one another. The Ubese homeworld is little known to the rest of the galaxy, as they tended to be very secretive, associating only within their own circles.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nThe Ubese are near-Humans who appear graceful but frail. They tend to have fair skin and dark hair, with eye colors of brilliant green or blue. They cannot grow any facial hair. Their facial structure is narrow, with high cheekbones and eyes that appear much too large for their faces when compared to baseline Humans. Males and females of the species both stand roughly the same height – around 1.4 meters and 1.9 meters – with males being slightly heavier of build than females. Their vocal chords cannot produce speech above a rasping whisper sound, so they use a highly refined form of sign language called Ubeninal when communicating with other Ubese.\n</p> <p>Few beings know what an Ubese looks like – they rarely, if ever, appear to non-Ubese unless concealed by masks, battle armor, or enviro-suits. Those who have interacted face to face with an Ubese have not recognized them as such, because there are no records in any databases that describe their appearances.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nLittle is known about Ubese culture. Away from their homeworld, wayward Ubese seem to care little for other societies' laws, customs and mores. They are mysterious wanderers, nomadic warriors who hide their inner secrets and agendas just as they hide their faces behind helmets and breath masks. Although most Ubese understand Basic, they rarely deigned to speak it, preferring to express themselves in their own language.\n\n</p> <p>They seem to be loyal to one another, despite nurturing a profound hatred toward most other members of the galactic community. They generally make their livings as mercenaries, bounty hunters, slavers, or assassins – professions where they get to vent their hatred without fear of retribution. \n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nUbertica is a planet located within the Ubertica system of the Mid Rim. While habitable, it has a relatively low level of atmospheric oxygen.\n</p> <p>Ubertica was settled by Ubese refugees after the destruction of Uba III. The Ubese who live here were called \"yrak pootczk Ubese\" by their cousins in the Uba system, a phrase implying cowardice and impure parentage.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nUbese is the native language of the Ubese, a species of Near-Humans that hail from Ubertica, Uba III and Uba IV. It is a metallic language, well-adapted to the rarefied atmosphere of the home planet from which the nomadic Ubese came.\n\n</p> <p>Ubese vocal cords cannot produce sound above raspy whispers, making them difficult to understand when their voices weren't amplified. The Ubese also developed a sign language, Ubeninal, as an alternative to communicate with other Ubese. Ubeninal has no written form. Most Ubese are fluent in Ubese language, Ubeninal and Basic, the common language of the galaxy, although they are only literate in their own language. Ubese rarely choose to speak Basic.</p>",

Best known for their technological aptitude, the Verpine are considered to be among the finest starship engineers in the galaxy.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nVerpine are thin bipedal insectoids, standing 1.9 meters tall on average. Unlike many insectoids, including the Kibnon to which they are distantly related, the Verpine have only four limbs (two arms and two legs), though there are instances of Verpine growing vestigial wings. Their heads are dominated by large compound eyes. They also have two antennae, one located behind each eye. Their hardened carapace, composed of a green chitinous substance called carahide, is as flexible as the skin of other creatures, yet tough enough to deflect a blade or even absorb a glancing blaster bolt. The Verpine circulatory system does not contain a heart — at least, not an organ which Human physiologists would identify as a heart.\n</p> <p>Verpine eyes are keen enough to pick out microscopic details. Their antennae contain tympanic nerves which pick up sound. Their antennae are also sensitive to radio waves, giving Verpine the natural ability to sense and transmit radio waves to communicate with another Verpine in their language over distances on the order of one hundred kilometers. Some observers mistake this nearly instant, silent communication for true telepathy. Thanks to their natural radio communication network, their colonies are run as a consensus democracy, with all Verpine instantly consulted on questions affecting the hive.\nGiven their reliance on radio communication, Verpine frequently suffer negative consequences when their antenna are damaged. \n</p> <p>Verpine come in two types—intelligent, hermaphroditic Verpine and unintelligent worker drones. At the time of their entrance into Galactic society, only five percent of Verpine were intelligent, but the demands of technological civilization required the Verpine to restructure their society. After the change, egg-laying Verpine use a special enzyme to ensure all eggs laid develop into intelligent Verpine. Any drones needed by a Verpine hive are produced via cloning.\n</p> <p>When a Verpine hive need more members, some of the fertile Verpine will be asked to lay eggs, while others will be assigned to fertilize them.

Since each Weequay's pheromones is unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan.

Weequays serving the Hutt clans are often very close to their homeworld, and will only have one or two braids. Female Weequay are usually bald, and do not follow this tradition.\n</p> <p>Weequay religion is complex, with many deities. Among them are the moon-god Quay and the thunder god Am-Shak. Quay is their chief god: indeed, \"Weequay\" translates to \"Follower of Quay\". Zealous Weequays perform ritual sacrifices in Quay's honor, at times resorting to murder, earning their culture a violent reputation. Each of their cities is centered around a shrine of black, polished stone, known as a thal, where the Weequay make offerings of food and valuables. Their religious code prohibits building thal off Sriluur, so off-world devotees are obligated to substitute animal sacrifices (usually large animals like banthas).\n</p> <p>The Weequays share their homeworld with Houk colonists, though not enthusiastically. The two societies sent to war on Sriluur in 10 BBY. The conflict ended after a decade, leaving many unemployed Weequay soldiers to find work as mercenaries and bounty hunters. This war also gave certain Weequay companies a good reputation throughout the galaxy as manufacturers of force pikes and other melee weapons.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nSriluur is a planet in the Tharin sector of the Outer Rim. Homeworld to the sentient Weequay species, Sriluur holds a key position along the Sisar Run, one of the many important hyperlanes connecting Hutt Space with the rest of the Outer Rim. The planet is orbited by five moons, most notably Ruul, the only one of the five able to support life. It is an arid world covered in deserts, volcanoes and acidic seas. Despite this, the planet is almost entirely self-sufficient thanks to an unlikely but very productive agricultural sector. The planet has enormous reserves of copper, but this resource goes largely untapped by miners. Historically, the planet is part of Hutt Space, which means Hutt crime lords and representatives of the Black Sun criminal organization are a common sight on Sriluur.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nSriluurian is the official language of the Sriluur system. The most notable species to speak this language is the Weequay on Sriluur. \n</p> <p>It is formed by guttural mumbles and subdued whispers. It also uses hieroglyphs as a written form.\n</p> <p>The language has some special characteristics that most languages in the galaxy lack: The Weequays can speak to one another and prevent outsiders from understanding them.\n</p> <p>Weequays also use pheromones to communicate with each other. However, only the members of one's same tribe can understand the pheromones of another Weequay. Sriluurian is a language used to communicate with people from other tribes.\n</p> <p>Most Weequays are fluent in both Sriluurian and Basic, although they are usually only literate in their own language.</p>",

    "WHIPHID" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Whiphid</h4> <p>\nWhiphids are tall, muscled, furred sentient beings from the planet Toola. They are notable for their great tusks. On Toola, Whiphids live a primitive lifestyle, hunting caraboose and other large animals, such as the motmot, their favored prey. Their language consists of approximately six thousand words. As Whiphids came into contact with more technically advanced races that came to Toola to buy ice, they began to show great curiosity about the rest of the galaxy. Many Whiphids left Toola, supporting themselves as big game hunters, mercenaries, or bounty hunters.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nWhiphids average about 2.5 meters and can weigh up to 400 kilos. They are covered by long yellow-white or gold fur and had stubby fur-covered tails. Their faces are elongated, with prominent foreheads and long, bowed cheekbones. A Whiphid's face is furless apart from a few hairs on the lips and chin. Two large tusks protrude from the lower jaw, and their massive arms end with thick three-fingered hands, the fingers ending in sharp claws. Female Whiphids tend to be slightly shorter and heavier than the males. Their eyes protrude slightly from their heads. Young Whiphids have shorter snouts and far less fur than adults.\n</p> <p>Since their homeworld of Toola is a cold planet of ice and snow, the Whiphid's body maintains a thick layer of blubber, which serves to insulate and reduce heat loss. Their thick fur also helps to protect them from the harsh climate and is also covered with natural oil that repells water and allows them to swim in Toola's frigid oceans. In the warmer periods of the spring and summer on Toola, the Whiphids lose several centimeters of fur and burn off much of their fat reserves. Their hollow cheekbones also widen slightly, since a broader face helps to dissipate heat. These biological changes are induced by warmer temperatures rather than by the cycle of the seasons. Whiphids in the wider galaxy, therefore, are more likely to have less fur and be smaller in size than their counterparts on their homeworld in winter.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nOn Toola, the Whiphids live together in tribes of three to ten couples. In the winter the tribes are nomadic and travel across the icy plains of the planet in search of prey. They camp near hunting grounds using round hide tents. During summer the tribes move to a permanent base that is constructed of stone and covered by animal hides and mud. A Whiphid tribe is led by an elder called a Spearmaster, who decides where the group should camp and what prey to hunt. \n</p> <p>Whiphid tribes are loose associations of individuals, and they do not have attachments to the tribes of their parents. They are a survival necessity and not an ideological construct or family unit. A tribe stays together as long as it was doing well, and individuals of unsuccessful tribes have no compunction against joining another tribe, nor do tribes have an issue with new members.\n</p> <p>The tribes of Toola travel across the planet on sleds and load-bearing sledges that are constructed of hide, horn, bone and leather thong. They are pulled by domesticated Tuggles, carnivorous animals native to Toola possessed of great stamina. Six Tuggles are capable of pulling a sledge all day with only a couple of breaks, if properly fed, for several days at a time. The design of the Whiphid sleds is such that they spread the load over a wide surface area and therefore allow for safe gliding over the icy plains.\n</p> <p>Tribes on Toola typically meet at hot springs, where they will trade and cooperate in big hunts. Whiphid tribes do not make war with each other or participate in skirmishes or raids against other tribes. In the mind of the Whiphids, this would reduce the number of hunters capable of hunting motmots and bring bad luck against the aggressive tribe. Individual Whiphids do have disagreements that can last for years and that often resulted in violent confrontations, but these are personal matters that do not involve others. Bullies in Whiphid society are rare, and an elder will take such an individual on a long hunt to sort them out. Those that do not learn the ways of the elder often do not return. Individuals within Whiphid society are not allowed to undermine its functioning.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nToola is a planet located in the Toola system and the cold homeworld of the Whiphids. It is located in the Slice.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nWhiphid is the native language of the Whiphid species from Toola. It is formed of snorts, growls and bellowing barks.\n</p> <p>There is no written form of Whiphid language. The language's working vocabulary is limited to six thousand words.\n</p> <p>Most Whiphids are only fluent in Whiphid, and not in Basic.\n</p>",

    "ZABRAK" : {
      "Description" : "<h4>Zabrak</h4> <p>\nThe Zabrak, also known as Iridonians when referring to the Zabrak who came from Iridonia, are a carnivorous Near-Human species native to Iridonia, a planet located in the Mid Rim known for its inhospitable terrain and fierce predatory life. They are a species known for having a fierce sense of self-determination and an equally dominant need for independence.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nZabrak are Near-Human, but have a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crowned the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signify that the time of their rite of passage is drawing near. \n</p> <p>The horns are one trait shared by the many Zabrak subspecies, which are divided by a number of physical characteristics that differ from subspecies to subspecies. These can include different skin tones (which included peachy white, pure white, yellow, red, tan, brown and black), horn patterns, hair growth (though it should be noted that most Zabraks, unlike Humans, cannnot grow eyelashes or facial hair) and eye color (which have certain pigmentations that Humans lack, such as purple, yellow, red, and orange).\n</p> <p>Another of the traits that made Zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These can symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflects their individual personalities.\n</p> <p>Internally, Zabraks possess a second heart. They also have great resistance to physical pain.\n</p> <p>Zabraks are capable of breeding with Humans, and a hybrid sub-species evolved on Dathomir called the Dathomirians, formed from the mating of Nightbrother Zabraks and Nightsister Humans.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nZabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a race with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this does not lead a Zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others, though there is often the occasional competition between colonies. This is not seen as a negative, however, for the Zabraks believe that the various experiences of the different colonies only served to add values to the race's overall value to the galaxy.\n</p> <p>Zabrak are proud, strong, and confident beings. They believe that nothing is truly impossible, and strive to prove skeptics wrong at every turn. Some Zabraks carry themselves with an air of superiority, frequently discussing the achievements of their people with pride that can border on arrogance. As warriors or adventurers, Zabrak tend to be dedicated, intense, and extremely focused.\n</p> <p>Zabrak from Iridonia are considered to be more war-like than Zabrak from their colony worlds, most likely due to the rugged terrain that makes up their home world. As such, they developed a highly physical style of martial arts, which is a requirement for young Zabrak to learn. It is not uncommon for Zabrak from Iridonia to be among the best hand-to-hand fighters and weaponsmiths in the galaxy. Zabrak from colony worlds also share that drive for excellence, but encourage their children to express it in other ways. It was thus not surprising to see that the Zabrak meet with success in many fields, ranging from medicine to entertainment.\n</p> <p>Zabrak will commonly take their names from animals native to Iridonia, with many Zabrak families named after the Bukk. Many Zabrak males are named after the Blok, Lok, and Zur. Many Zabrak females are known to take their names from the Triz.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nIridonia is the homeworld of the Zabrak species. Due to the harsh living conditions, the Zabrak are a hardy species. They took to flight and then space travel as soon as they could develop the technology, and by the time the Duros encountered them, they had already colonized five systems. Notable Iridonians included Darth Maul, Bao-Dur, Drell Kahmf, Sirak and Maris Brood.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nZabraki, or Zabrak language is the native language of the Zabrak species from Iridonia. Most Zabrak are fluent in both Zabrak language and Basic, being literate in both languages.\n</p> <p>The word Kaz, as in the name Kaz Lo, means \"clever\" or \"innovative\". The word \"Ouc\" as in the name \"Oucoa\" pronounced \"Oak-oa\" means \"Brave\" or \"Fearless one\".</p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Zeltron</h4> <p>\nZeltrons are a near-Human species, made physically distinctive by their skin and hair, which comes in different shades of red ranging from pink to deep red to black. Most of them are considered highly attractive by Human, near-Human, and even some non-humanoid standards. They are also known for being extremely gullible.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nZeltrons are one of the few near-Human races who have differentiated from the baseline stock enough to be considered a new species of the Human genus, rather than simply a subspecies. They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhance their attractiveness and likeability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure become very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.\n</p> <p>Another difference between Zeltrons and Humans is the presence of a second liver, which allowed Zeltrons to enjoy a larger number of alcoholic beverages than other humanoids.\n</p> <p>It is said that Zeltrons tend to look familiar to other people, even if they have never met them. Most Zeltrons are in excellent physical shape, and their incredible metabolisms allow them to eat even the richest of foods.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nZeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. They look upon monogamy as a quaint, but impractical, practice. They are also very gifted with holograms, and are the creators of Hologram Fun World. Their Elixir of Infatuation is notorious for its powerful amorous effects.\n</p> <p>Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire. It is common to see Zeltrons wearing shockingly bright shades of neon colors in wildly designed bikinis, or nearly skin tight clothing of other sorts with bizarre color designs, patterns, and symbols.\n</p> <p>Zeltrons are often stereotyped as lazy thrill-seekers, owing to their hedonistic pursuits. Indeed, their homeworld of Zeltros thrives as a luxury world and \"party planet,\" as much for their own good as for others. If anyone isn't having a good time on Zeltros, the Zeltrons will certainly know of it, and will do their best to correct it. Though their first inclination is to love; if pushed to do so, Zeltrons can prove to be formidable warriors.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nZeltros is a planet in the Inner Rim, and the homeworld of the Zeltron race. An opulent world, hedonism is the doctrine encouraged by the empathetic Zeltrons, and Zeltros is continuously in a state of never ending revelry. The Zeltron appreciation of beauty in its many forms leads to luxurious art and architecture covering the world, and the galaxy's most wealthy favored Zeltros as a vacation destination. Many who come to the planet are taken in by the celebratory atmosphere and the powerful pheromones of the Zeltron people to the point they find it difficult to leave, and even planetary invasions often flounder in the face of Zeltros' planet-wide festivities.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nGalactic Basic Standard (or Galactic Basic, Galactic Standard, Galaxy Standard or just Basic) is the most prevalent and most used language in the galaxy and is spoken by the Zeltron.</p>",

      "Description" : "<h4>Zygerrian</h4> <p>\nThe Zygerrians are a sentient species of Near-Humans native of the planet Zygerria. Members of the species are medium-sized, standing 1.7 meters tall on average and weighing around sixty kilograms. The Zygerrians are distinguished by a number of bony spurs on their face. The species is well-known for its long history of violence, war, and slavery, which they view as a natural order of life. This contributes to the fact that the Zygerrians are feared across the galaxy. The founders of the Zygerrian Slavers Guild, the Zygerrians conducted slaving operations in the Outer Rim Territories for centuries before the Clone Wars. At one point, the species was crushed by the Jedi Order, but they eventually recovered.\n</p> <p><b>Physiology:</b>\nThe Zygerrians are a bipedal sentient species, biologically related to baseline Humans. Feline in appearance, the species possesses strong, angular features, with long fangs jutting from their jaws. The Zygerrians' faces and ears are almost entirely covered with fur, which ranged in color from brown to gray or red. Males traditionally have more hair than females, with straps of fur growing on their cheeks. Male Zygerrians also display a number of bony spurs protruding from the chin. Females lacked the chin spurs, but they instead have smaller protrusions on their forehead.\n\n</p> <p>With an average lifespan of eighty-one years, the Zygerrians reach adolescence at ten years, are considered adult at seventeen, middle-aged at forty, and old at sixty-one. Medium-sized, they usually grow up to 1.7 meters and weigh around sixty kilograms. They generally have sallow complexions and are physically strong, but some individuals suffer from obesity.\n</p> <p><b>Society:</b>\nA warlike species, the Zygerrians hold strength—both physical and mental—in great esteem, viewing it as a means to gain power and authority. They believe that it is the natural order of life for the strong to dominate the weak, so slavery is normal for the species, and a display of weakness can mean death or enslavement in their culture. Because of this, the species willingly cultivates an image as dangerous and unpredictable to discourage others from challenging them. This tactic works, and the Zygerrians are feared in spaceports across the galaxy, earning fame for their history of violence, piracy, slavery, and war. Despite all of that, they are still considered an advanced civilization. The species' natural physical strength is well-complemented by their mastery of various weapons, such as retractable shock whips. The Zygerrians utilize various creatures to travel on their homeworld, including the winged brezak creatures, which the Zygerrian royal guard use to patrol the ground for escaped slaves. In order to transfer slaves between planets, the species uses highly durable freighters. Each transport containes space for numerous enslaved individuals, yet only require one pilot to operate it. The Zygerrians are cunning, ensuring that they have the upper hand in any situation. They traditionally settle their differences with an unarmed fistfight.\n</p> <p>The Zygerrian people are organized into clans and classes. They have a noble class, many members of which, despite their high status, pursue a career in the military. The Zygerrian Head of State is a monarch; female rulers hold the title of Queen. The center of the Zygerrian society, however, is the Zygerrian Slavers Guild that focuses on slave trade in the Outer Rim Territories. Founded centuries before the Clone Wars, the organization thrived in their territory, mostly due to its well-organized nature and the Galactic Republic's diffuse presence in the Outer Rim. Each Zygerrian slaver has to pay a yearly membership fee to join the Guild and is then allocated a patch of space in which to work. The size of that patch varies from one planet to an entire system, depending on the amount of money the slaver paid as his fee. Compared to other slaver organizations, the Zygerrians are considered \"honorable\" by the Twi'leks, who prefer them as slave masters, since the Zygerrians' approach to slaving reduced the damage it did to the Twi'lek society.\n</p> <p><b>Homeworld:</b>\nZygerria isthe homeworld of the near-Human Zygerrian species.  The planet experienced success during the thousands of years the Zygerrians maintained their slave labor industry, but after the Jedi cracked down on the slaving operations, it faded from glory. Slavery was brought up again when the Zygerrians collaborated with the Separatists during the Clone Wars.\n\n</p> <p>During the Zygerrian Slave Empire's height, the population had fortresses and cities built on top of the mesas scattered throughout the planet, using slave labor. After the empire's collapse, these buildings remained impressive sights to tourists, bringing visitors even from Alderaan.\n\n</p> <p>Aside from being a major slavery world, it hosts several podraces annually, which attracted large numbers of spectators.\n</p> <p><b>Language:</b>\nZygerrian primarily speak Galactic Basic Standard.</p>",
